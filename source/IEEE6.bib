abstract={The emergence of many new computing applications, such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and smart homes, has been made possible by the large pool of cloud resources and services. However, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet the requirements of delay-sensitive business applications, such as low latency, mobility support, and location awareness. In this context, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is introduced to improve the quality of experience (QoE) by bringing cloud resources and services closer to the user by leveraging available resources in the edge networks. However, the performance of MEC is dynamic in nature due to its location awareness, mobility and proximity. As a result, an effective mechanism is needed for providing efficient dynamic service maintenance for edge services. In this paper, we propose applying the Skyline Graph Model and employing the Directed Acyclic Graph theory to store and update mobile edge services. Specifically, the Skyline Graph (SG) algorithm is designed to solve the insertion, deletion, updating and searching of mobile edge services to achieve efficient maintenance for edge services. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both real-world web services and simulated datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches. The results show that our algorithms can achieve significantly better performance and robustness than the baseline algorithm.},

abstract={Machine Learning brings intelligence services to IoT systems, with Edge Computing contributing for edge nodes to be part of these services, allowing data to be processed directly in the nodes in real time. This paper introduces a new way of creating a self-configurable IoT node, in terms of communications, supported by machine learning and edge computing, in order to achieve a better efficiency in terms of power consumption, as well as a comparison between regression models and between deploying them in edge or cloud fashions, with a real case implementation. The correct choice of protocol and configuration parameters can make the difference between a device battery lasting 100 times more. The proposed method predicts the energy consumption and quality of signal using regressions based on node location, distance and obstacles and the transmission power used. With an accuracy of 99.88% and a margin of error of 1.504 mA for energy consumption and 98.68% and a margin of error of 1.9558 dBm for link quality, allowing the node to use the best transmission power values for reliability and energy efficiency. With this it is possible to achieve a network that can reduce up to 68% the energy consumption of nodes while only compromising in 7% the quality of the network. Besides that, edge computing proves to be a better solution when energy efficient nodes are needed, as less messages are exchanged, and the reduced latency allows nodes to be configured in less time.},

abstract={Conceptual design plays an important role in a product development process. Significant development of technologies in the cyber-physical system (CPS) provides innovative approaches for product conceptual design. This paper proposes an architecture of CPS for conceptual design that realizes the acquisition of real-time physiological data from the physical world and the feedback of psychological states from the cyber world. As understanding and meeting the needs of customers have been recognized as significant aspects for conceptual design, an intelligent psycho-physiological approach that incorporates electroencephalogram (EEG) into the Kano model is adopted in this CPS for real-time customer needs analysis. The sample entropy (SampEn) extracted from EEG data is an endogenous neural indicator for customers' psychological states. A support vector machine using this SampEn as input is trained for classifying different categories of quality attributes defined in the Kano model. A case study is conducted to testify the feasibility of the approach proposed in this paper.},

pages={1520-1526},
abstract={The penetrating ability of ultrasound (US) com-bined with its real-time operation make it the perfect tool for investigating muscle contraction mechanics during complex functional tasks, e.g., locomotion. Changes in fascicle lengths and pennation angles of muscle fascicles strongly correlate with the capacity of skeletal muscles to produce forces, thereby represent fundamental parameters to be tracked. While the gold standard for extracting these features from US images is still based on manual annotation, the availability of recording devices capable of generating big data of muscle dynamics makes such manual approach unfeasible, setting the need for automated muscle images annotation tools. Existing approaches, however, are seriously limited, also in view of the continuous developments and technology ad-vancements for ultrafast US and plane-wave imaging. In fact, they rely on conventional (slow) B-mode imaging, make use of point tracking approaches (which often fail due to out-of-plane motion), or can only operate on very high quality images. To overcome all these limitations, we present AEPUS, an automated image labeling tool capable of extracting pennation angles from low quality images using a very small number of plane waves, therefore making it capable of exploiting all the benefits of ultrafast US. Clinical Relevance - Ultrasound is a standard research tool to investigate alterations of spastic muscles in children with Cerebral Palsy. We propose a reliable and time-efficient method to track muscle features in ultrasound images and support clinical biomechanists in their analyses.},

abstract={Vehicular network aims at providing intelligent transportation and ubiquitous network access. Edge computing is able to reduce the consumption of core network bandwidth and serving latency by processing the generated data at the network edge, and social network is able to provide precise services by analyzing user’s personal behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new network system referred to as vehicular social edge computing (VSEC) that inherits the advantages of both edge computing and social network. VSEC is capable of improving the drivers’ quality of experience while enhancing the service providers’ quality of service. In order to further improve the performance of VSEC, the network utility is modeled and maximized by optimally managing the available network resources via two steps. First, the total processing time is minimized to achieve the optimal payment of the user to each edge device for each kind of the required resource. Second, a utility model is proposed, and the available resources are optimally allocated based on the results from the first step. The two optimization problems are solved by the Lagrangian theory, and the closed-form expressions are obtained. Numerical simulations show different capacities in different scenarios, which may provide some useful insights for VSEC design.},

title={A Novel Social Recommendation Method Fusing User’s Social Status and Homophily Based on Matrix Factorization Techniques},
year={2019},
volume={7},
number={},
pages={18783-18798},
abstract={As one of the most successful recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering provides a useful recommendation by associating an active user with a crowd of users who share the same interests. Although some achievements have been achieved both in theory and practice, the efficiency of recommender systems has been negatively affected by the problems of cold start and data sparsity recently. To solve the above problems, the trust relationship among users is employed into recommender systems to build a learning model to further promote the prediction quality and users' satisfaction. However, most of the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms fail to take into account the fact that users with different levels of trust and backgrounds, that is, user's social status and homophily have different degrees of influence on their friends. In this paper, a novel social matrix factorization-based recommendation method is proposed to improve the recommendation quality by fusing user's social status and homophily. User's social status and homophily play important roles in improving the performance of recommender systems. We first build a user's trust relationship network based on user social relationships and the rating information. Then, the degree of trust is calculated through the trust propagation method and the PageRank algorithm. Finally, the trust relationship is integrated into the matrix factorization model to accurately predict unknown ratings. The proposed method is evaluated using real-life datasets including the Epinions and Douban datasets. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms.},

abstract={Intelligent matching of heterogeneous remote sensing images is a common basic problem in the field of intelligent remote sensing image processing. Aiming at the difficulty of matching satellite-aerial remote sensing images, this article proposes an intelligent matching method for heterogeneous remote sensing images based on style transfer. First, based on the idea of image style transfer of a generative adversarial networks, this method improves the conversion effect of the model on heterogeneous images by constructing a new generative network loss function and converts satellite images into aerial images. Then, the advanced deep learning-based matching algorithms D2-Net and LoFTR are used to achieve matching between the generated aerial image and the original aerial image. Finally, this transformation relationship is mapped to the corresponding satellite–aerial image pair to obtain the final matching result. The image style transfer experiments and the matching experiments we carry out under different test datasets show that the smooth cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks proposed in this article can effectively reduce the complexity of the algorithm and improve the quality of image generation. In addition, combining it with deep learning-based feature-matching methods can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of the matching algorithm.

abstract={A rise in the population has immensely increased the pressure on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are also opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture sector, along with the development of hardware and software systems. The public and private sector projects and startup's started all over the globe to provide smart and sustainable solutions in precision agriculture are also discussed. The current scenario, applications, research potential, limitations, and future aspects are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of IoT a precision farming framework is also proposed in this article.},

year={2020},

pages={8485-8501},
abstract={Several causes make brain cancer identification a challenging task for neurosurgeons during the surgical procedure. The surgeons' naked eye sometimes is not enough to accurately delineate the brain tumor location and extension due to its diffuse nature that infiltrates in the surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, a support system that provides accurate cancer delimitation is essential in order to improve the surgery outcomes and hence the patient's quality of life. The brain cancer detection system developed as part of the “HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection” (HELICoiD) European project meets this requirement exploiting a non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis: the hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A crucial constraint that this system has to satisfy is providing a real-time response in order to not prolong the surgery. The large amount of data that characterizes the hyperspectral images, and the complex elaborations performed by the classification system make the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems essential to provide real-time processing. The most efficient implementation developed in this work, which exploits the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology, is able to classify the biggest image of the database (worst case) in less than three seconds, largely satisfying the real-time constraint set to 1 minute for surgical procedures, becoming a potential solution to implement hyperspectral video processing in the near future.},

pages={99816-99827},
abstract={One of the biggest challenges hindering a table tennis robot to play as well as a professional player is the ball’s accurate motion control, which depends on various factors such as the incoming ball’s position, linear, spin velocity and so forth. Unfortunately, some factors are almost impossible to be directly measured in real practice, such as the ball’s spin velocity, which is difficult to be estimated from vision due to the little texture on the ball’s surface. To perform accurate motion control in table tennis, this study proposes to learn a ball stroke strategy to guarantee desirable “target landing location” and the “over-net height” which are two key indicators to evaluate the quality of a stroke. To overcome the spin velocity challenge, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based stroke approach is developed with the spin velocity estimation capability, through which the system can predict the relative spin velocity of the ball and stroke it back accurately by iteratively learning from the robot-environment interactions. To pre-train the DRL-based strategy effectively, this paper develops a virtual table tennis playing environment, through which various simulated data can be collected. For the real table tennis robot implementation, experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control strategy compared to that of the traditional aerodynamics-based method with an average landing error around 80mm and the landing-within-table probability higher than 70%.},

title={Ensemble Computational Intelligent for Insomnia Sleep Stage Detection via the Sleep ECG Signal},

volume={10},

pages={108710-108721},
abstract={Insomnia is a common sleep disorder in which patients cannot sleep properly. Accurate detection of insomnia disorder is a crucial step for mental disease analysis in the early stages. The disruption in getting quality sleep is one of the big sources of cardiovascular syndromes such as blood pressure and stroke. The traditional insomnia detection methods are time-consuming, cumbersome, and more expensive because they demand a long time from a trained neurophysiologist, and they are prone to human error, hence, the accuracy of diagnosis gets compromised. Therefore, the automatic insomnia diagnosis from the electrocardiogram (ECG) records is vital for timely detection and cure. In this paper, a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach is proposed based on the power spectral density (PSD) of the heart rate variability (HRV) to detect insomnia in three classification scenarios: (1) subject-based classification scenario (normal Vs. insomnia), (2) sleep stage-based classification (REM Vs. W. stage), and (3) the combined classification scenario using both subject-based and sleep stage-based deep features. The ensemble learning of random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifiers are used to perform the first and second classification scenarios, while the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier is used to perform the third combined scenario. The proposed framework includes data collection, investigation of the ECG signals, extraction of the signal HRV, estimation of the PSD, and AI-based classification via hybrid machine learning classifiers. The proposed framework is fine-tuned and evaluated using the free public PhysioNet dataset over fivefold trails cross-validation. For the subject-based classification scenario, the detection performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy is recorded to be 96.0%, 94.0%, and 96.0%, respectively. For the sleep stage-based classification scenario, the detection evaluation results are recorded equally with 96.0% for ceiling level accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. For the combined classification scenario, the LDA classifier has achieved the best insomnia detection accuracy with 99.0%. In the future, the proposed hybrid AI approach could be applicable for mobile observation schemes to automatically detect insomnia disorders.},

pages={2687-2699},
abstract={For task-scheduling problems in cloud computing, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed here. First, with an aim toward the biodiversity of resources and tasks in cloud computing, we propose a resource cost model that defines the demand of tasks on resources with more details. This model reflects the relationship between the user's resource costs and the budget costs. A multi-objective optimization scheduling method has been proposed based on this resource cost model. This method considers the makespan and the user's budget costs as constraints of the optimization problem, achieving multi-objective optimization of both performance and cost. An improved ant colony algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem. Two constraint functions were used to evaluate and provide feedback regarding the performance and budget cost. These two constraint functions made the algorithm adjust the quality of the solution in a timely manner based on feedback in order to achieve the optimal solution. Some simulation experiments were designed to evaluate this method's performance using four metrics: 1) the makespan; 2) cost; 3) deadline violation rate; and 4) resource utilization. Experimental results show that based on these four metrics, a multi-objective optimization method is better than other similar methods, especially as it increased 56.6% in the best case scenario.},

pages={6186-6193},
abstract={Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for images with high definition and fine textures, but images captured in natural scenes usually suffer from complicated blurry artifacts, caused mostly by object motion or camera shaking. Since these annoying artifacts greatly decrease image visual quality, deblurring algorithms have been proposed from various aspects. However, most energy-optimization-based algorithms rely heavily on blur kernel priors, and some learning-based methods either adopt pixel-wise loss function or ignore global structural information. Therefore, we propose an image deblurring algorithm based on a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN), in which the scale-recurrent generator extracts sequence spatio–temporal features and reconstructs sharp images in a coarse-to-fine scheme. To thoroughly evaluate the global and local generator performance, we further propose a receptive field recurrent discriminator. Besides, the discriminator takes blurry images as conditions, which helps to differentiate reconstructed images from real sharp ones. Last but not least, since the gradients are vanishing when training the generator with the output of the discriminator, a progressive loss function is proposed to enhance the gradients in back propagation and to take full advantage of discriminative features. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of RCGAN over state-of-the-art algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

abstract={The maximum edge weighted clique problem (MEWCP), an extension of the classical maximum clique problem, is an important NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The problem has been widely used in various areas. The objective of this paper is to design an efficient local search algorithm to solve the MEWCP. First, the proposed scoring strategy is used to evaluate the benefit of adding and swapping operators. Second, the vertex weighting strategy is used to increase the diversity of solutions and the configuration checking strategy is used to avoid the cycling problem. By combining these three strategies, we propose multiple rules to select the added vertex or the swapped vertex pair. Based on the multiple rules, an efficient local search algorithm, namely, local search based on multiple rules (LSMR), is proposed. LSMR is compared with several representative algorithms on massive graph instances. The experimental results indicate that LSMR is superior to competitors in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency in most instances.},

abstract={Identifying shoe-print impressions in the scene of crime (SoC) from database images is a challenging problem in forensic science due to the complicated impressing surface, the partial absence of on-site impressions, and the huge domain gap between the query and the gallery images. The existing approaches pay much attention to feature extraction while ignoring its distinctive characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-part weighted convolutional neural network (MP-CNN) for shoe-print image retrieval. Specifically, the proposed CNN model processes images in three steps: 1) dividing the input images vertically into two parts and extracting sub-features by a parameter-shared network individually; 2) calculating the importance weight matrix of the sub-features based on the informative pixels they contained and concatenating them as the final feature, and; 3) using the triplet loss function to measure the similarity between the query and the gallery images. In addition to the proposed network, we adopt an effective strategy to enhance the quality of the images and to reduce the domain gap using the U-Net structure. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms other fine-grained cross-domain methods on SPID dataset and obtains comparative results with the state-of-the-art shoe-print retrieval methods on FID300 dataset.},

First, the opposition-based learning strategy is utilized to increase the diversity and quality of the initial population. Then, the adaptive dynamic switching probability is introduced, which can effectively balance the global and local search according to the current number of iterations. Finally, the t-distribution variation is used to increase the population diversity and to help the algorithm jump out of the local optimum. The simulation experiments on eight classical test functions show that OTAFPA has better global optimization ability, which improves the convergence speed and the solution accuracy of the algorithm. The OTAFPA also shows superior performance in practical applications of user identification across social networks.},

abstract={The influential factors of green logistics development have been an important research topic for academics. However, little attention has been devoted to studying the issue of the prioritization and the hierarchical structure of these factors. The purpose of this study is to identify the key factors influencing the development of green logistics, and to explore the prioritization and the hierarchical structure of the influential factors. An indicator system for influential factors of green logistics development is first developed based on the theory of triple bottom line, including sixteen indicators or factors. The comprehensive influences and the prioritization of these sixteen factors are then analyzed using the DEMATEL method and the multi-level hierarchical structure of these factors is constructed by applying the ISM method. The results indicate that government policies, public supports, laws and regulations, green education, green technology innovations, consumer green demands, quantity and quality of green logistics talents are more influential than the other factors. Social factors including laws and regulations and government policies, public supports and green education are the underlying factors affecting the development of green logistics. Economic factors are at the middle levels and environmental factors are at the surface-level of the hierarchical structure. Recommendations are finally given to governmental agencies and business firms. These findings will be beneficial to promoting the sustainable development of green logistics.},

volume={8},
number={},
pages={39439-39444},
abstract={In actual distribution process, the traffic flow varies with time, and each consumer has multiple fuzzy windows. To minimize the total distribution cost and mean consumer dissatisfaction, this paper sets up a vehicle routing problem (VRP) model with multiple fuzzy time windows, based on time-varying traffic flow. In addition, the Ito algorithm was improved based on time-varying traffic flow. The model and algorithm were verified through example simulation, in comparison with ant colony optimization (ACO). During the simulation, the improved Ito algorithm effectively reduced the distribution cost and consumer dissatisfaction, and outperformed the ACO in solving efficiency and solution quality. The results fully demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The research findings provide a desirable solution to VRPs with multiple fuzzy windows and time-varying traffic flow in the real world.},

title={Scheduling Extra Train Paths Into Cyclic Timetable Based on the Genetic Algorithm},

volume={8},
number={},
pages={102199-102211},
abstract={In order to support the process of scheduling a hybrid cyclic timetable, this paper is devoted to inserting additional non-cyclic train paths into existing cyclic timetable. The adding train paths problem is an integration of timetable scheduling and rescheduling problem. The train dispatcher can not only modify the given timetable to manage the interruptions in existing operations, but also establish schedules for additional trains. A multi-objective model minimizing both the travel time of additional trains and the variation of existing trains is proposed in this paper. In addition, we consider both general constraints and some additional practical constraints, such as the overtaking priority constraint, reasonable adjustment of initial schedules and the scheduled connections. This problem is very difficult and must be solved in practice. A heuristic algorithm is introduced to find high-quality solutions for large-scale cases within reasonable computing time. Based on high-speed railway line in China, the case studies illustrate the methodology and compare the performance of trains. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed solution approach to the adding train paths problem is promising.},

abstract={Data mining has actively contributed to solving many real-world problems with a variety of techniques. Traditional approaches in this field are classification, clustering and regression. During the last few years a number of chal-lenges have emerged, such as imbalanced data, multi-label and multi-instance problems, low quality and/or noisy data or semi-supervised learning, among others [item 1) in the Appendix]. When these non-standard scenarios are encountered in the realm of big data, it remains an uncharted research territory, although a growing effort has been made to break the limits. The current trend is to address the classical and newly emerging data mining problems in big data and knowledge processing. Granular computing provides a powerful tool for multiple granularity and multiple-view data analysis at differ-ent granularity levels, which has demonstrated strong capabil-ities and advantages in intelligent data analysis, pattern recog-nition, machine learning and uncertain reasoning [item 2) inthe Appendix]. Big data often contains a significant amount of unstructured, uncertain and imprecise data. There are new challenges regarding the scalability of granular computing when addressing very big data sets [item 3) in the Appendix]. Big data mining relies on distributed computational strate-gies; it is often impossible to store and process data on one single computing node. The exploration of data mining and granular computing in big data and knowledge processing is an emerging field which crosses multiple research disciplines and industry domains, including transportation, communications, social network, medical health, and so on.},

abstract={With the explosion of big data technology, healthcare data is continuously and rapidly growing, with abundant and various values. There are wide varieties of data and heterogeneous healthcare data (images, text, video, raw sensor data, etc.) that are generated and required to be effectively stored, processed, queried, indexed and analyzed. These datasets differ widely in their volume, variety, velocity and value, including patient-oriented data such as electronic medical records (EMR), public-oriented data such as public health data, and knowledge-oriented data such as drug-to-drug, drug-to-disease, and disease-to-disease interaction registries. Big data in healthcare brings great challenges but plays an important role in healthcare transformation. The traditional techniques do not compromise end-users’ Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of data availability, data response delay, etc. It is urgent to develop software tools and techniques that support rapid query processing and speed-up data analytics, which provide awareness and knowledge in real-time.},

abstract={With growing attention from both academia and industry, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), comprised of a multitude of connected devices, is supposed to monitor, collect, exchange, analyze, and instantly act on information to intelligently change the industrial device’s behavior or the industrial environment (e.g., autonomous reaction to unexpected changes in production by effectively detecting failures and triggering maintenance processes). Toward this goal, the convergence of sensor networks, cloud computing, and big data in IIoT is recently identified as an essential component. Specifically, to capture various data in IIoT, sensor networks are deployed. Meanwhile, to store and process data powerfully in IIoT, cloud computing platforms are developed. Moreover, to glean valuable findings from the massive data in IIoT, big data analytics tools are utilized. However, to integrate sensor networks, cloud computing, and big data in IIoT in a robust way, there are a lot of tough issues to be solved with respect to various aspects (e.g., framework, greenness, security, quality of service, etc.).},

abstract={Social networks have become one of the most popular platforms for people to communicate and interact with their friends and share personal information and experiences (e.g., Facebook owns over 1.23 billion monthly active users). The increasing popularity of social networks has generated extremely large-scale user data (e.g., Twitter generates 500 million tweets per day and around 200 billion tweets per year). These data can help improve people’s quality of life as well as benefit various interest groups such as advertisers, application developers, and so on. However, privacy may be compromised if learning algorithms are used to infer unpublished privacy information from published data. Hence, user data privacy preservation has become one of the most urgent research issues in social networks.},

abstract={The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has paved the way for the future of smart cities. The large volume of data over the IoT can enable decision-making for various applications such as smart transportation, smart parking, and smart lighting. The key to the success of smart cities is data collection and aggregation over the IoT. Recently, crowdsensing has become a new data collection paradigm over the IoT, which can realize large-scale and fine-grained data collection with low cost for various applications. For example, we can leverage the power of the crowd to build a real-time noise map with microphones on smartphones. Despite the advantages of crowdsensing and the IoT, there are many challenges to utilize crowdsensing over the IoT for smart cities, such as how to allocate tasks to appropriate users to provide high-quality sensing data, how to incentivize users to participate in crowdsourcing, how to detect the reliability of the crowdsourced data, and how to protect the privacy of users.},

abstract={We live in a world with growing disparity in the quality of life available to people in the developed and developing countries. Healthcare in the developing world is fraught with numerous problems such as the lack of health infrastructure, and human resources, which results in very limited health coverage. The field of health informatics has made great strides in recent years towards improving public health systems in the developing world by augmenting them with state-of-the-art information and communication technologies (ICT). Through real-world deployment of these technologies, there is real hope that the health industry in the developing world will progress from its current, largely dysfunctional state to one that is more effective, personalized, and cost effective. Health informatics can usher a new era of personalized health analytics, with the potential to transform healthcare in the developing world. In conjunction with mHealth and eHealth, many other important health informatics trends—such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data, crowdsourcing, cloud computing—are also emerging. Exponentially growing heterogeneous data, with the help of big data analytics, has the potential to provide descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive health insights as well as enable new applications such as telemedicine and remote diagnostics and surgery. Such systems could enhance the overall process of monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis of diseases.},
