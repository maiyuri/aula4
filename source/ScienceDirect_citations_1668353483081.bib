abstract = {Stroke is an example of a complex and multi-factorial disease involving multiple organs, timescales, and disease mechanisms. To deal with this complexity, and to realize Precision Medicine of stroke, mathematical models are needed. Such approaches include: 1) machine learning, 2) bioinformatic network models, and 3) mechanistic models. Since these three approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, a hybrid modelling approach combining them would be the most beneficial. However, no concrete approach ready to be implemented for a specific disease has been presented to date. In this paper, we both review the strengths and weaknesses of the three approaches, and propose a roadmap for hybrid modelling in the case of stroke care. We focus on two main tasks needed for the clinical setting: a) For stroke risk calculation, we propose a new two-step approach, where non-linear mixed effects models and bioinformatic network models yield biomarkers which are used as input to a machine learning model and b) For simulation of care scenarios, we propose a new four-step approach, which revolves around iterations between simulations of the mechanistic models and imputations of non-modelled or non-measured variables. We illustrate and discuss the different approaches in the context of Precision Medicine for stroke.}

abstract = {Geography is suitable for the study of sustainability from a transdisciplinary perspective, which takes the human-land relationship as the core research. As a key obstacle to rural sustainability, poverty is an external manifestation of the coupling maladjustment of elements in human-land territorial systems. As the world's largest developing country, China eradicated extreme poverty in 2020 and made significant contributions to global poverty reduction. Especially over the last eight years, China has implemented a targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) strategy and has continuously promoted theoretical, organizational and institutional innovations for poverty reduction. From the perspective of geography, this paper extracts the experiences of China's TPA strategy, represented by the "5W2H" mode. The research concludes that: (1) Precise identification, as the foundation of TPA, aims to introduce a registration system to obtain records of all poor households and then answer the "5W" (what, where, why, who, when) issues of the geography of poverty. (2) Precise assistance is the key of TPA, which aims to solve the issue of "how to offer help and support". The barriers to escaping poverty can be accomplished through policies and measures that focus on the diverse causes of poverty and considering different situations. (3) Accurate assessments are an essential means of TPA, relevant to solve "how to measure the end of poverty alleviation", and third-party evaluations play an important role in improving the accuracy of poverty alleviation. (4) The TPA mechanism lies in reconstructing the human-land-industry structures in the impoverished areal system. It is urgent to introduce China's successful experience and typical modes of TPA for global human-earth system coordination and sustainable development and contribute to building a community of human destiny.}

Although the nighttime light (NTL) data have been proved to be effective in economic estimation, it cannot reflect the human activities that occur during the daytime. Recently, with the widespread use of smart mobile devices, the location based social media (LBSM) data are increasingly being used as a proxy for real-time human activities. However, little work was carried out to explore the potential of LBSM data in estimating economic development at different scales in China. This study filled this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of Tencent user density (TUD) data, a typical type of LBSM data in China, in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) modeling at the provincial, municipal, and county scales. In this study, we employed holiday and non-holiday TUD sample data to simulate the annual TUD data, and compared it with the new generation NTL data, NPP/VIIRS images. The results showed that although the simulated annual TUD data does not perform better than NPP/VIIRS-NTL data in provincial and municipal GDP estimation, it outperforms NPP/VIIRS-NTL data at the county scale. More importantly, the simulated annual TUD data are much more powerful and reliable than NPP/VIIRS-NTL data in underdeveloped areas with complex terrain, such as the Northwest and Southwest China, as well as in more developed areas with separation of work and housing, such as the North China and South China. This is mainly because TUD data can reduce the impact of natural factors such as terrain on data collection as well as reflect both daytime and nighttime human activities. This study confirmed that the LBSM-TUD data is a potential and promising data source for economic modeling in small scale areas of China, which will help to support China's regional economic evaluation.}

The machine learning-based prediction strategies have attained significant attention in tackling a broad class of challenging nonlinear and complex problems. The random forest algorithm is a well-proven machine learning algorithm due to its ease of training and implementation, as it requires minimal preprocessing. The random forest algorithm has hitherto not been employed for estimating air quality parameters, such as relative humidity. In this study, the random forest approach is implemented to estimate the relative humidity as a function of dry- and wet-bulb temperatures. A well-known commercial process simulator called Aspen HYSYS¬Æ V10 is linked with MATLAB¬Æ version 2019a to establish a data mining environment. The robustness of the prediction model is evaluated against varying wet-bulb depressions. There is high absolute deviation that indicates a lower prediction performance of the model against the higher wet-bulb depression i.e., ~20.0¬†¬∞C. The random forest model can predict relative humidity with a 1.1% mean absolute deviation compared to the values obtained through Aspen HYSYS. The performance of the RF estimation model is also compared with a well-known support vector regression model. The random forest model demonstrates 74.4% better performance than the support vector machine model for the problem of interest, i.e., relative humidity estimation. This study will significantly help the practitioners in efficient designing of air-dependent energy systems as well as in better environmental management through rigorous prediction of relative humidity.}

This overview, aimed at all participants in the digital transformation of the chemical industry, presents ‚Äúdos and don‚Äôts‚Äù method recommendations for three successive steps: strategy development to define goals, (organisational) mobilisation for implementation, and project delivery. Successful strategy development requires assembling an empowered and skilled team; truly understanding the data science and digital transformation topics; accepting emergence and iteration; and focusing on real needs. Mobilising an organisation is essential so that it can translate strategy to tactics and value. Within organisations, one must therefore: enable project identification; set up a supportive organisational structure and skilful people within it. Looking outside, participation in partnerships is essential to access external resources. Delivery of valuable projects is the end goal. A diverse portfolio is needed, as well as effective collaborations between subject matter experts and data scientists. Technically, the use of software best practice is beneficial, and care must be taken of the data themselves. In the longer term, data science opportunities will extend beyond merely improving traditional analytics to make them faster, better, and more user-friendly. The early identification of beneficial future trends requires encouraging those individuals who have an interest in disruptive currents, and the perceptiveness to sense their areas of application.}

Globally, neonatal mortality remains unacceptability high. Physiological monitoring is foundational to the care of these vulnerable patients to assess neonatal cardiopulmonary status, guide medical intervention, and determine readiness for safe discharge. However, most existing physiological monitoring systems require multiple electrodes and sensors, which are linked to wires tethered to wall-mounted display units, to adhere to the skin. For neonates, these systems can cause skin injury, prevent kangaroo mother care, and complicate basic clinical care. Novel, wireless, and biointegrated sensors provide opportunities to enhance monitoring capabilities, reduce iatrogenic injuries, and promote family-centric care. Early validation data have shown performance equivalent to (and sometimes exceeding) standard-of-care monitoring systems in premature neonates cared for in high-income countries. The reusable nature of these sensors and compatibility with low-cost mobile phones have the future potential to enable substantially lower monitoring costs compared with existing systems. Deployment at scale, in low-income countries, holds the promise of substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes.}

In this study, a high-resolution terrestrial LiDAR was used to acquire point clouds of plants under field conditions, and a data processing pipeline was developed to detect plant main stalks and nodes, and then to extract two phenotypic traits including node number and main stalk length. The proposed method mainly consisted of three steps: first, extract skeletons from original point clouds using a Laplacian-based contraction algorithm; second, identify the main stalk by converting a plant skeleton point cloud to a graph; and third, detect nodes by finding the intersection between the main stalk and branches. Main stalk length was calculated by accumulating the distance between two adjacent points from the lowest to the highest point of the main stalk. Experimental results based on 26 plants showed that the proposed method could accurately measure plant main stalk length and detect nodes; the average R2 and mean absolute percentage error were 0.94 and 4.3% for the main stalk length measurements and 0.7 and 5.1% for node counting, respectively, for point numbers between 80,000 and 150,000 for each plant.

abstract = {The study aims to identify relevant variables to improve the prediction performance of the crash injury severity (CIS) classification model. Unfortunately, the CIS database is invariably characterized by the class imbalance. For instance, the samples of multiple fatal injury (MFI) severity class are typically rare as opposed to other classes. The imbalance phenomenon may introduce a prediction bias in favour of the majority class and affect the quality of the learning algorithm. The paper proposes an ensemble-based variable ranking scheme that incorporates the data resampling. At the data pre-processing level, majority weighted minority oversampling (MWMOTE) is employed to treat the imbalanced training data. Ensemble of classifiers induced from the balanced data is used to evaluate and rank the individual variables according to their importance to the injury severity prediction. The relevant variables selected are then applied to the balanced data to form a training set for the CIS classification modelling. An empirical comparison is conducted through considering the variable ranking by: 1) the learning of single inductive algorithm with imbalanced data where the relevant variables are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data; 2) the learning of single inductive algorithm with MWMOTE data and the relevant variables identified are applied to the balanced data to form the training data; and 3) the learning of ensembles with imbalanced data where the relevant variables identified are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data. Bayesian Networks (BNs) classifiers are then developed for each ranking method, where nested subsets of the top ranked variables are adopted. The model predictions are captured in four performance indicators in the comparative study. Based on three-year (2014‚Äì2016) crash data in Ghana, the empirical results show that the proposed method is effective to identify the most prolific predictors of the CIS level. Finally, based on the inference results of BNs developed on the best subset, the study offers the most probable explanations to the occurrence of MFI crashes in Ghana.}

In contrast to PDW design methodologies that emphasize physical consolidation of all data of interest on a single (perhaps distributed) computing platform, along with early-binding approaches that pre-materialize transformations and changes to the source data, LDW techniques allow for the integration and transformation of data at run-time and typically physically move or modify much less data in advance. In an environment with premium hardware such as multi-temperate storage, the successful design of LDWs depends on replication of high value data to their physical core to maximize spatial locality. Identifying and collocating high value data is a non-trivial task that has not been adequately explored in the context of LDWs in multi-temperate storage systems. In this paper, we gather queries to construct an OLAP workload for use in supporting and evaluating LDW design algorithms for a large healthcare organization. We introduce new algorithms to address the preprocessing of the workload, identification of data clusters to support OLAP queries, and assignment of clusters to appropriate (hot, warm, and cold) storage tiers, allowing the LDW to deliver results more efficiently by covering a higher percentage of its query workload using the fastest storage devices. Any use case involving copying data from sources to tiered storage targets for analytic querying could benefit from the techniques and solutions presented here.}

We prepared a dataset comprising 4069 historical landslide locations and 11 conditioning factors (altitude, slope degree, profile curvature, distance to river, aspect, plan curvature, distance to road, distance to fault, rainfall, geology and land-sue) to construct a geospatial database and divided the data into the training and the testing dataset. We then developed RNN and CNN algorithms to generate landslide susceptibility maps of Iran using the training dataset. We calculated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and used the area under the curve (AUC) for the quantitative evaluation of the landslide susceptibility maps using the testing dataset. Better performance in both the training and testing phases was provided by the RNN algorithm (AUC¬†‚Äã=¬†‚Äã0.88) than by the CNN algorithm (AUC¬†‚Äã=¬†‚Äã0.85). Finally, we calculated areas of susceptibility for each province and found that 6% and 14% of the land area of Iran is very highly and highly susceptible to future landslide events, respectively, with the highest susceptibility in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province (33.8%). About 31% of cities of Iran are located in areas with high and very high landslide susceptibility.

We build a framework that revolves around the ADMS lifecycle and propose that each phase challenges organizations with ‚Äúchoices‚Äù related to technical and processual characteristics ‚Äì ways to design, implement and use these systems in practice. We argue that it is important that organizations make these strategic choices with awareness and responsibly, as ADMS‚Äô consequences affect a broad array of stakeholders (the workforce, suppliers, customers and society at-large) and involve ethical considerations. With this article we make two main contributions. First, we identify key choices associated with the design, implementation and use in practice of ADMS in organizations, that build on past literature and are tied to timely industry-related examples. Second, we provide IS scholars with a broad research agenda that will promote the generation of new knowledge and original theorizing within the domain of the strategic applications of ADMS in organizations.}

High-throughput experimentation (HTE) is a well-established technique used in the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate compound synthesis and route optimization through automated chemical processes. A key part of any HTE workflow is the analytical component, through which the reaction outcome can be determined. The development of new analytical techniques capable of high-throughput data generation from nanoscale chemical reactions has been required to streamline the HTE process and address challenges generated through the recent move to miniaturize synthesis. In this Perspective, we review the currently available state-of-the-art analytical methods, discuss the challenges encountered in high-throughput analysis‚Äîwith a particular focus on the analysis of nanoscale reactions, and provide a future outlook on potential developments in the field.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
There are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on cancer care but there is little direct evidence to quantify any effect. This study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the detection and management of colorectal cancer in England.
Methods
Data were extracted from four population-based datasets spanning NHS England (the National Cancer Cancer Waiting Time Monitoring, Monthly Diagnostic, Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care and the National Radiotherapy datasets) for all referrals, colonoscopies, surgical procedures, and courses of rectal radiotherapy from Jan 1, 2019, to Oct 31, 2020, related to colorectal cancer in England. Differences in patterns of care were investigated between 2019 and 2020. Percentage reductions in monthly numbers and proportions were calculated.
Findings
As compared to the monthly average in 2019, in April, 2020, there was a 63% (95% CI 53‚Äì71) reduction (from 36‚Äà274 to 13‚Äà440) in the monthly number of 2-week referrals for suspected cancer and a 92% (95% CI 89‚Äì95) reduction in the number of colonoscopies (from 46‚Äà441 to 3484). Numbers had just recovered by October, 2020. This resulted in a 22% (95% CI 8‚Äì34) relative reduction in the number of cases referred for treatment (from a monthly average of 2781 in 2019 to 2158 referrals in April, 2020). By October, 2020, the monthly rate had returned to 2019 levels but did not exceed it, suggesting that, from April to October, 2020, over 3500 fewer people had been diagnosed and treated for colorectal cancer in England than would have been expected. There was also a 31% (95% CI 19‚Äì42) relative reduction in the numbers receiving surgery in April, 2020, and a lower proportion of laparoscopic and a greater proportion of stoma-forming procedures, relative to the monthly average in 2019. By October, 2020, laparoscopic surgery and stoma rates were similar to 2019 levels. For rectal cancer, there was a 44% (95% CI 17‚Äì76) relative increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in April, 2020, relative to the monthly average in 2019, due to greater use of short-course regimens. Although in June, 2020, there was a drop in the use of short-course regimens, rates remained above 2019 levels until October, 2020.
Interpretation
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sustained reduction in the number of people referred, diagnosed, and treated for colorectal cancer. By October, 2020, achievement of care pathway targets had returned to 2019 levels, albeit with smaller volumes of patients and with modifications to usual practice. As pressure grows in the NHS due to the second wave of COVID-19, urgent action is needed to address the growing burden of undetected and untreated colorectal cancer in England.

Based on ultra-fidelity models, more accurate service, e.g. real-time monitoring and failure prediction, can be reached. Against the background, some scholars studied the related theories and methods on modeling to depict various features of physical objects. Some scholars studied how to use Internet of Things to realize the connections and interactions, thereby keeping the consistency between the virtual and physical spaces. During this process, a new question arises that how to update the models once digital twin models are inconsistent with the practical situations. To solve the problem, this paper proposed a general digital twin model update framework at first. Then, the update methods for multi-dimension models are further explored. The cutting tool is the core component of machine tools which are the key equipment in industry. The precise cutting tool models are essential for realizing the digitalization and servitization of machine tools. Therefore, this paper takes a cutting tool as the application object to discuss how to conduct physics model update based on the proposed framework and methods. Through model update, a more accurate and updated tool wear model could be obtained, which contributes to the prognostics and health management for machine tools.}

These historical temperature changes of the networks are not available for such a long period and they are usually limited to the past few years. To exploit the available implemented technologies for PdM , the missing data must become available to understand the ageing patterns and expand the ageing model to the pipes in use. In this research, various Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest algorithm (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been tested to train a model and backward simulate the temperature changes of the system based on recorded weather data. Various none-temperature variables have been used to enhance the prediction qualities to the real-world data. The historical temperature changes of the system shall be used for different ageing estimation such as fatigue cycles or remaining useful life of the polyurethane (PUR) foam.}

Tourism systems like the Danube Region are composed of several local and regional destinations, and even when these are branded together for tourists the integration of these into one system is often compromised by national boundaries and socio-economic differences. This study shows how the Danube region is composed of different clusters of destinations, and how national boundaries have a strong shielding effect in the interregional movements of tourists. A methodology based on network analysis with efficient clustering algorithms applied on large geotagged datasets from User Generated Content is proposed. Flickr data was used to map short time-interval visitor flows along the linear system of the river Danube. 18 regional clusters integrated into 3 strong, but separated destination systems were identified by modularity analysis. The central integrating effect of the large capital cities and the boundary-shielding effect impeding the total integration of this large-scale system were made measurable.}

Properly planning platoons and evaluating the potential of truck platooning are crucial to trucking companies and transportation authorities. This study proposes a series of data mining approaches to learn spontaneous truck platooning patterns from massive trajectories. An enhanced map matching algorithm is developed to identify truck headings by using digital map data, followed by an adaptive spatial clustering algorithm to detect trucks‚Äô instantaneous co-moving sets. These sets are then aggregated to find the network-wide maximum platoon duration and size through frequent itemset mining for computational efficiency. The GPS data were collected from truck fleeting systems in Liaoning Province, China for platooning performance measures and spatiotemporal platooning distribution visualization. Results show that approximately 36% spontaneous truck platoons can be coordinated by speed adjustment without changing routes and schedules. The average platooning distance and duration ratios for these platooned trucks are 9.6% and 9.9%, respectively, leading to a 2.8% reduction in total fuel consumption. This study also distinguishes the optimal platooning periods and space headways for national freeways and trunk roads, and prioritize the road segments with high possibilities of truck platooning. The derived results are reproducible, providing useful policy implications and operational strategies for large-scale truck platoon planning and roadside infrastructure construction.}

Then we afford an overview of ANN-based chemometrics applied in LIBS analysis, involving material identification/classification, component concentration quantification, and some unconventional applications as well. Furthermore, a comprehensive discussion on ANN-LIBS methodologies is provided from four aspects. First, a few general progressing trends are displayed. Next we expound some specific implementation techniques, including variable selection, network construction, data set utilization, network training, model evaluation, and chemometrics selection. In addition, the limitations of ANN approaches are remarked, mainly concerning overfitting and interpretability. Finally a prospect of future development of ANN-LIBS chemometrics is presented. Throughout the discussion quite a few good practices have been highlighted. This review is expected to shed light on the further upgrade of ANN-based LIBS chemometrics in the future.}

abstract = {Given that the one-size-fits-all approach to mobile health interventions have limited effects, a personalized approach might be necessary to promote healthy behaviors and prevent chronic conditions. Our systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized mobile interventions on lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption), and identify the effective key features of such interventions. We included any experimental trials that tested a personalized mobile app or fitness tracker and reported any lifestyle behavior measures. We conducted a narrative synthesis for all studies, and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Thirty-nine articles describing 31 interventions were included (n¬†=¬†77,243, 64% women). All interventions personalized content and rarely personalized other features. Source of data included system-captured (12 interventions), user-reported (11 interventions) or both (8 interventions). The meta-analysis showed a moderate positive effect on lifestyle behavior outcomes (standardized difference in means [SDM] 0.663, 95% CI 0.228 to 1.10). A meta-regression model including source of data found that interventions that used system-captured data for personalization were associated with higher effectiveness than those that used user-reported data (SDM 1.48, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.19). In summary, the field is in its infancy, with preliminary evidence of the potential efficacy of personalization in improving lifestyle behaviors. Source of data for personalization might be important in determining intervention effectiveness. To fully exploit the potential of personalization, future high-quality studies should investigate the integration of multiple data from different sources and include personalized features other than content.}

abstract = {Helpfulness prediction techniques have been widely incorporated into online decision support systems to identify high-quality reviews. Most current studies on helpfulness prediction assume that a review's helpfulness only relies on information from itself. In practice, however, consumers hardly process reviews independently because reviews are displayed in sequence; a review is more likely to be affected by its adjacent neighbors in the sequence, which is largely understudied. In this paper, we proposed the first end-to-end neural architecture to capture the missing interaction between reviews and their neighbors. Our model allows for a total of 12 (three selection √ó four aggregation) schemes that contextualize a review into the context clues learned from its neighbors. We evaluated our model on six domains of real-world online reviews against a series of state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results confirm the influence of sequential neighbors on reviews and show that our model significantly outperforms the baselines by 1% to 5%. We further revealed how reviews are influenced by their neighbors during helpfulness perception via extensive analysis. The results and findings of our work provide theoretical contributions to the field of review helpfulness prediction and offer insights into practical decision support system design.}

To improve the urban planning processes and to enhance quality of life for end-users in urban spaces, a better understanding of the factors influencing pedestrian movement is required by decision-makers within the urban design and planning industry. The aim of this study is to present a novel means to assess pedestrian routing in urban environments. As a unique contribution to knowledge and practice, this study: (a) enhances the body of knowledge by developing a conceptual model to assess and classify pedestrian movement behaviours, utilising machine learning algorithms and location data in conjunction with spatial attributes, and (b) extends previous research by revealing spatial visibility as a driver for pedestrian movement in urban environments. The importance of the findings lies in the perspective of revealing novel insights concerning individual preferences and behaviours of end-users and the utilisation of urban spaces. The approaches developed can be utilised for observations in large-scale contexts, as an addition to traditional methods. Application of the model in a high pedestrian traffic-dense retail urban area in London reveals clear and consistent relationships amongst spatial visibility, individuals‚Äô motivation, and knowledge of the area. Key behaviours established in the study area are grouped into two activity categories: (i) Utilitarian walking (with motivation - expert and novice striders) and (ii) Leisure walking (no motivation - expert and novice strollers). The approach offers an insightful and automated means to understand pedestrian flow in urban contexts and informs wider wayfinding, walkability, and transportation knowledge.}

However, traditional evaluation of footprints for mega cities or urban agglomerations requires overmuch different types of high-quality data. There is a great need of seeking a smart model/approach with declined data requirements for evaluation of footprints where part of data can hardly be accessed. Here we propose a new ensemble inversion model (EIM) based on integrated multitask machine learning (MML) and multi-modeling stacking (MMS) algorithms for smart evaluation and prediction of water, carbon and ecological footprints. The accuracy and generalization capability of the model are illustrated through three largest urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR). The testing results show that the EIM achieves similar prediction performance compared to traditional footprints calculation methods (R2¬†=¬†0.91, RMSE¬†=¬†0.18, MAE¬†=¬†0.11), yet greatly reduces the amount of required data by approximately 80%. Moreover, the accuracy of the EIM is improved by more than 20%, compared with other models using a single inversion algorithm. The modeling results also show that 1) water, carbon and ecological footprints are significantly positively correlated, and 2) an annual increase of 4.8% can be found in terms of the urban environmental pressure index (UEPI), and its projection is even less optimistic for the future.}

Integrating the technology, organisation and people (TOP) framework with core elements of the theory of innovation assimilation and its impact on a range of AI-Augmented HRM outcomes, or what we refer to as (HRM(AI)), this paper develops a coherent and integrated theoretical framework of HRM(AI) assimilation. Such a framework is timely as several post-adoption challenges, such as the dark side of processual factors in innovation assimilation and system-level factors, which, if unattended, can lead to the opacity of AI applications, thereby affecting the success of any HRM(AI). Our model proposes several testable future research propositions for advancing scholarship in this area. We conclude with implications for theory and practice.}

Here, we examine best practice by marshalling learnings from 45 workers representing 20 organisations working globally across the disaster risk management (DRM) lifecycle, including physical and social science, NGOs, technological developers, and (inter)governmental regulatory bodies. We present a series of generalisable and scalable guidelines that are novel in being independent of any specific natural hazard or development setting, designed to maximise the positive societal impact of exploiting mobile technologies. Specifically, the local context, dynamics, and needs must be carefully interrogated a priori, while any product should ideally be co-developed with local stakeholders through a user-centered design approach.}

This manuscript proposes and illustrates the implementation of a new methodological framework for DT policy planning in the case of Andalusia, the olive world leader region, but applicable to other regions and sectors, with two objectives: 1) to quantitatively determine the importance of the conditioning factors of DT in the olive sector in the short/medium term, by developing an AHP/SWOT/PESTLE model, and 2) to design public policies to strengthen the DT, taking advantage of the potentialities and alleviating the deficiencies, by carrying out a quantitative TOWS analysis. The knowledge of diverse groups of experts, i.e. stakeholders in the sector, has been used in all analyses due to the lack of reliable data and the complex nature of the issues analysed. The results show that the opportunities and strengths are more prominent than weaknesses and threats for DT. Environmental issues stand out as an opportunity to boost DT. There is also a growing interest in developing an interoperability strategy which is an opportunity to overcome the low technological integration of the value chain. DT can also enable a more transparent value chain and improved traceability. Some negative factors are the lack of evidence on the economic viability of investment in digital technologies, shortage of labour and young farmers, and potential unintended and unanticipated effects of DT. Important policies strategies to foster DT are: improving environmental efficiency though DT; promoting youth employment in the sector; enhancing coordination among innovation actors; developing a common interoperability strategy; and fostering technological integration in the sector.}

However, other stages in the development of medical imaging biomarkers do not require such intensive computing resources, which has led to the convenience of integrating different computing backends tailored for the processing demands of the various stages of processing workflows. We present in this article a distributed and federated repository architecture for the development and application of medical image biomarkers that combines multiple cloud storages with cloud and HPC processing backends. The architecture has been deployed to serve the PRIMAGE (H2020 826494) project, aiming to collect and manage data from paediatric cancer. The repository seamlessly integrates distributed storage backends, an elastic Kubernetes cluster on a cloud on-premises and a supercomputer. Processing jobs are handled through a single control platform, synchronising data on demand. The article shows the specification of the different types of applications and a validation through a use case that make use of most of the features of the platform.}

Therefore, the current study specifies different functions related to data analytics and privacy (i.e., data collection, storage, verification, analytics, and dissemination of insights), compares how these functions might be performed at different levels (consumer, intermediary, and firm), outlines how well different analytics methods address consumer privacy, and draws several conclusions, along with future research directions.}

Both the developed and developing countries are undergoing a high concentration of pollution levels. Fine particulate matter PM2.5 (particles having a diameter less than 2.5Œºm) and PM10 (particles having a diameter less than 10Œºm) can easily penetrate the lungs and respiratory system and causes adverse health issues like heart attacks, cardiovascular diseases, lung function reduction. Real-time pollutant information is of great importance to providing prompt and complete information on air quality. Air pollution forecasting is another significant step of air pollution management, which can help policymakers and citizens make proper decisions to prevent air pollution-related diseases. This research study explores a novel pollutant forecasting model named as Multi-output temporal convolutional network autoencoder (MO-TCNA). The model accumulates each step's predicted values to perform multi-step ahead long-term forecasting for multiple pollutants and multiple sites in a single training model. The MO-TCNA network serves both the PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants forecasting for various locations instead of performing single output and site-specific pollutant forecasting. Consequently, the experimental results show that the MO-TCNA network is time-saving and has better performance than the traditional site-specific forecasting models.}

It extensively uses sensing technologies (e.g., electronic health monitoring devices), computations (e.g., machine learning), and communication (e.g., interaction between the health data centers). As health data contain sensitive private information, including the identity of patient and carer and medical conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times. Leakage of these private information affects the personal life, including bullying, high insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical history. Thus, the security, privacy of and trust on the information are of utmost importance. Moreover, government legislation and ethics committees demand the security and privacy of healthcare data. Besides, the public, who is the data source, always expects the security, privacy, and trust of their data. Otherwise, they can avoid contributing their data to the precision health system. Consequently, as the public is the targeted beneficiary of the system, the effectiveness of precision health diminishes. Herein, in the light of precision health data security, privacy, ethical and regulatory requirements, finding the best methods and techniques for the utilization of the health data, and thus precision health is essential. In this regard, firstly, this paper explores the regulations, ethical guidelines around the world, and domain-specific needs. Then it presents the requirements and investigates the associated challenges. Secondly, this paper investigates secure and privacy-preserving machine learning methods suitable for the computation of precision health data along with their usage in relevant health projects. Finally, it illustrates the best available techniques for precision health data security and privacy with a conceptual system model that enables compliance, ethics clearance, consent management, medical innovations, and developments in the health domain.}

Sperm transcriptome data (2 x 75 PE sequencing) generated from bulls (n¬†=¬†8) of high-fertile (n¬†=¬†4) and low-fertile (n¬†=¬†4) classified based on the fertility rate (41.52¬†¬±¬†1.07 vs 36.04¬†¬±¬†1.04%) were analyzed with different bioinformatics tools for alignment, quantitation, and differential gene expression studies. TopHat2 was effectual compared to HISAT2 and STAR for sperm mRNA due to the higher exonic (6% vs 2%) mapping percentage and quantitating the low expressed genes. TopHat2 also had significantly strong correlation with STAR (0.871, p¬†=¬†0.05) and HISAT2 (0.933, p¬†=¬†0.01). TopHat2 and Cufflinks combo quantitated the number of genes higher than the other combinations. Among the tools (Cuffdiff, DESeq, DESeq2, edgeR, and limma) used for the differential gene expression analysis, edgeR and limma identified the largest number of significantly differentially expressed genes (p¬†<¬†0.05) with biological relevance. The concordance analysis concurred that edgeR had an edge over the other tools. It also identified a higher number (9.5%) of fertility-related genes to be differentially expressed between the two groups.

In literature and in societal debates, these two transformations are sometimes described as antagonistic and sometimes as convergent but are rarely studied together. Using an innovation system approach, this paper discusses how diverse ecologisation pathways grasp digitalisation in the French agricultural sector; and do not discriminate against organic farming. Based on interviews with key representatives of conventional agriculture, organic agriculture and organisations that promote or develop digital agriculture, we explore how these actors perceive and participate in digital development in agriculture. We show that although all the actors are interested and involved in digital development, behind this apparent convergence, organic and conventional actors perceive neither the same benefits nor the same risks and consequently do not implement the same innovation processes. We conclude that digitalisation has different meanings depending on the actors‚Äô paradigm, but that digital actors fail to perceive these differences. This difference in perception should be taken into account if digital development is to benefit all kinds of agriculture and not discriminate against organic farming and more widely, against agroecology.}

Standardization of visual assessments and deployment of imaging techniques have improved the accuracy and reliability of stress assessment in comparison with unaided visual measurement. The growing capabilities of machine learning (ML) methods in conjunction with image-based phenotyping can extract new insights from curated, annotated, and high-dimensional datasets across varied crops and stresses. We propose an overarching strategy for utilizing ML techniques that methodically enables the application of plant stress phenotyping at multiple scales across different types of stresses, program goals, and environments.}

abstract = {Climate change and anthropogenic disturbance are two main drivers for vegetation dynamics on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Alpine meadow and alpine steppe are the primary rangeland ecosystem types on the QTP. However, the vegetation trends of the two land cover types and the underlying mechanisms behind their variation remain under debate. In this study, we used Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) 3g Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (i.e., GIMMS NDVI3g) by coupling the Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) model and the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model to analyze alpine meadow and alpine steppe vegetation trends on the QTP between 1982 and 2015. We also assessed vegetation variation response to climatic and anthropogenic indicators in conjunction with climatic and human footprint datasets. Results show that growing season NDVI (GSNDVI) values increased overall for both alpine meadow (0.0001 year‚àí1, p¬†=¬†0.33) and alpine steppe (0.0002 year‚àí1, p¬†<¬†0.05) throughout 1982‚Äì2015. Significant greening trends in both alpine meadow (0.0007 year‚àí1; p¬†<¬†0.05) and alpine steppe (0.0005 year‚àí1; p¬†<¬†0.05) ecosystems were obtained before 1998 and 2001, respectively. However, browning trends ascertained by GSNDVI (‚àí0.0006 year‚àí1; p¬†= 0.12) in alpine meadows were observed throughout 1998‚Äì2015, while greening trends ascertained by GSNDVI (0.0002 year‚àí1; p¬†=¬†0.12) in alpine steppes were observed throughout during 2001‚Äì2015. Opposing trends in precipitation, solar radiation, and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) occurred before and after breakpoints in both ecosystems. For the alpine meadow ecosystem, adverse precipitation trends caused browning before 1998 followed by greening after 1998 in the Three-River-Source National Park (TNP). Conversely, opposing changes in precipitation, solar radiation, and SPEI resulted in greening before 1998 followed by browning after 1998 in southern Tibet and the southeastern QTP. Alpine meadow vegetation trends were generally dominated by solar radiation before 1998 and jointly by precipitation and solar radiation after 1998. Prior to 2001 variation in alpine steppe greenness was controlled by precipitation, while after 2001 solar radiation dominated. Along with an increase in human footprint pressure (HFP) gradients, greenness trends gradually increased before 1998 but reversed after 1998 in the alpine meadow ecosystem. Additionally, greenness trends gradually decreased before 2001 but remained unchanged after 2001 for the alpine steppe ecosystem. These results highlight the different effects that climate change and anthropogenic disturbances have had on alpine meadow and alpine steppe ecosystems on the QTP over different time frames.}

abstract = {Numerous studies have focused on making telemedicine smart through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. These works span a wide range of research areas to enhance telemedicine architecture such as network communications, artificial intelligence methods and techniques, IoT wearable sensors and hardware devices, smartphones and cloud computing. Accordingly, several telemedicine applications covering various human diseases have presented their works from a specific perspective and resulted in confusion regarding the IoT characteristics. Although such applications are useful and necessary for improving telemedicine contexts related to monitoring, detection and diagnostics, deriving an overall picture of how IoT characteristics are currently integrated with the telemedicine architecture is difficult. Accordingly, this study complements the academic literature with a systematic review covering all main aspects of advances in IoT-based telemedicine architecture. This study also provides a state-of-the-art telemedicine classification taxonomy under IoT and reviews works in different fields in relation to that classification. To this end, this study checked the ScienceDirect, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Web of Science databases. A total of 2121 papers were collected from 2014 to July 2020. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion criteria. A final set of 141 articles were selected and classified into two categories, each followed by subcategories and sections. The first category includes an IoT-based telemedicine network that accounts for 24.11% (n¬†=¬†34/141). The second category includes IoT-based telemedicine healthcare services and applications that account for 75.89% (n¬†=¬†107/141). This multi-field systematic review has exposed new research opportunities, motivations, recommendations and challenges that need attention for the synergistic integration of interdisciplinary works. This extensive study also lists a set of open issues and provides innovative key solutions along with a systematic review. The classification of diseases under IoT-based telemedicine is divided into 14 groups. Furthermore, the crossover in our taxonomy is demonstrated. The lifecycle of the context of IoT-based telemedicine healthcare applications is mapped for the first time, including the procedure sequencing and definition for each context. We believe that this study is a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in providing direction and valuable information for future research. This study can also address the ambiguity in the trends in IoT-based telemedicine.}

However, the existing studies have some limitations: (1) The existing studies only considered one aspect of macro factors and constructed models based on a few data samples. (2) The methods commonly used cannot address the non-linear relationship or calculate the feature importance. The findings obtained from such models may be limited and biased. To address the limitations, this study proposes a BO-CV-XGBoost framework to explore the macro factors related to traffic fatality rate classes based on a high-dimensional dataset that fully considers the impact of multi-factor interaction with adequate data samples. The proposed framework is applied to a dataset in the US. 453 county-level macro factors are collected from various data sources, covering ten macro aspects, including topography, transportation, etc. The optimized BO-CV-XGBoost model obtains the best classification performance with an AUC of 0.8977 and an accuracy of 85.02%. Compared with other methods, the proposed model has superiority on fatality rate classification. Ten macro factors are identified, including ‚ÄòCurrent-dollar GDP‚Äô, ‚Äòhighway miles per person‚Äô, etc. The ten factors contain four aspects of information, including economics, transportation, education, and medical condition. Geographic information system (GIS) techniques are further used for spatial analysis of the identified macro factors. Therefore, targeted and effective measures are accordingly proposed to prevent traffic fatalities and improve road safety}

abstract = {With the rapid development of social economy, the traffic volume of urban roads has raised significantly, which has led to increasingly serious urban traffic congestion problems, and has caused much inconvenience to people‚Äôs travel. By focusing on the complexity and long-term dependence of traffic flow sequences on urban road, this paper considered the traffic flow data and weather conditions of the road section comprehensively, and proposed a short-term traffic flow prediction model based on the attention mechanism and the 1DCNN-LSTM network. The model combined the time expansion of the CNN and the advantages of the long-term memory of the LSTM. First, the model employs 1DCNN network to extract the spatial features in the road traffic flow data. Second, the output spatial features are considered as the input of LSTM neural network to extract the time features in road traffic flow data, and the long-term dependence characteristics of LSTM neural network are adopted to improve the prediction accuracy of traffic flow. Next, the spatio-temporal characteristics of road traffic flow were regarded as the input of the regression prediction layer, and the prediction results corresponding to the current input were calculated. Finally, the attention mechanism was introduced on the LSTM side to give enough attention to the key information, so that the model can focus on learning more important data features, and further improve the prediction performance. The experimental results showed that the prediction effect of the 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention model under the weather factor was better than that without considering the weather factor. At the same time, compared with traditional neural network models, the prediction effect of the proposed model revealed faster convergence speed and higher prediction accuracy. It can be found that for short-term traffic flow prediction on urban roads, the 1DCNN-LSTM network structure considering the attention mechanism provides superior features.}

abstract = {Background
Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) data elements are contained in both structured and unstructured documents in electronic health records and require manual data collection. The goal of this study is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to replicate manual chart review for PJI data elements.
Methods
PJI was identified among all total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures performed at a single academic institution between 2000 and 2017. Data elements that comprise the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria were manually extracted and used as the gold standard for validation. A training sample of 1208 TJA surgeries (170 PJI cases) was randomly selected to develop the prototype NLP algorithms and an additional 1179 surgeries (150 PJI cases) were randomly selected as the test sample. The algorithms were applied to all consultation notes, operative notes, pathology reports, and microbiology reports to predict the correct status of PJI based on MSIS criteria.
Results
The algorithm, which identified patients with PJI based on MSIS criteria, achieved an f1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.911. Algorithm performance in extracting the presence of sinus tract, purulence, pathologic documentation of inflammation, and growth of cultured organisms from the involved TJA achieved f1-scores that ranged from 0.771 to 0.982, sensitivity that ranged from 0.730 to 1.000, and specificity that ranged from 0.947 to 1.000.
Conclusion
NLP-enabled algorithms have the potential to automate data collection for PJI diagnostic elements, which could directly improve patient care and augment cohort surveillance and research efforts. Further validation is needed in other hospital settings.

Firstly, the CO2 emission control technology and the external influencing factors are summarized in this paper, which have laid the foundation for researching the internal biological intrinsic characteristics of carbon fixation by microalgae. Based on photosynthetic reactions, in-situ reaction experiments, hydrodynamic simulations and metabolic networks have been integrated to analyze the biological intrinsic characteristics of carbon fixation by microalgae. The collation of representative studies on theory and quantitative calculation methods reveals that free energy dissipation seriously affects the carbon fixation efficiency of microalgae; Secondly, thermodynamics and metabolic networks are discussed. The role of thermodynamics in addressing the constraints is explored mainly from the perspective of energy conversion mechanisms, free energy dissipation mechanisms, framework and methods. Metabolic networks are studied using sampling methods based on thermodynamic systems and metabolic engineering based on a systems perspective; Thirdly, the key supporting technologies and biological intrinsic characteristics are reviewed from an interdisciplinary perspective, and the researches on metabolic networks based on thermodynamic constraints are given; Finally, challenges are summarized to provide a basis and direction for future research.}

Laplacian eigen maps and Gaussian kernel functions are used to compress the AIS data and extract the turning points of all ships. Fuzzy adaptive density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (FA-DBSCAN) technique is used to cluster the turning points obtained at the preprocessing stage to obtain the turning region. Optimal turn region matching is used to connect the turning regions of similar routes, and the SRU neural network algorithm is used to learn the relationship between different types, sizes, and drafts of ships in each turning region; extract the feature-turning points; and obtain the recommended coastal routes, speed, and course of each type of ship. In the experimental stage, a large variety of AIS data from two sea areas are used to compare and analyze the designed route and real-ship data through LSTM and SRU experiments. The results show that the SRU algorithm improves the training speed and accuracy in comparison to LSTM, while the generated automatic route meets the requirements of navigation practice.}

abstract = {The freeway accident detection and classification have attracted much attention of researchers in the past decades. With the popularity of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) on mobile phones and onboard equipment, increasing amounts of real-time vehicle trajectory data can be obtained more and more easily, which provides a potential way to use the multi-vehicle trajectory data to detect and classify an accident on freeways. The data has the advantages of low cost, high penetration, high real-time performance, and being robust to the outdoor environment. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for accident detection and classification based on the multi-vehicle trajectory data. Different from the existing methods using GNSS positioning data, the proposed method not only uses the position information of the related vehicles but also tries to capture the development tendencies of the trajectories of accident vehicles over a period of time. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network model is developed to recognize an accident from the normal driving of vehicles and also identify the type of the accident, and the six types of traffic accidents are considered in this study. To train and test the proposed model, the simulated trajectory data is generated based on PC-Crash, including the normal driving trajectories and the trajectories before, in, and after an accident. The results indicate that the detection accuracy of the proposed method can reach up to 100%, and the classification accuracy can reach up to 95%, which both outperform the existing methods using other data. In addition, to ensure the robustness of the detection accuracy, at least 1¬†s of duration and 5¬†Hz of frequency for the trajectory data should be adopted in practice. The study will help to accurately and fastly detect an accident, recognize the accident type, and future judge who is liable for the accident.}

In the real world, however, eliminating throughput bottlenecks is a challenge. This is due to the landscape of complex factory dynamics, with several hundred machines operating at any given time. Academic researchers have tried to develop tools to help identify and eliminate throughput bottlenecks. Historically, research efforts have focused on developing analytical and discrete event simulation modelling approaches to identify throughput bottlenecks in production systems. However, with the rise of industrial digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI), academic researchers explored different ways in which AI might be used to eliminate throughput bottlenecks, based on the vast amounts of digital shop floor data. By conducting a systematic literature review, this paper aims to present state-of-the-art research efforts into the use of AI for throughput bottleneck analysis. To make the work of the academic AI solutions more accessible to practitioners, the research efforts are classified into four categories: (1) identify, (2) diagnose, (3) predict and (4) prescribe. This was inspired by real-world throughput bottleneck management practice. The categories, identify and diagnose focus on analysing historical throughput bottlenecks, whereas predict and prescribe focus on analysing future throughput bottlenecks. This paper also provides future research topics and practical recommendations which may help to further push the boundaries of the theoretical and practical use of AI in throughput bottleneck analysis.}

Information management is a vast, multi-disciplinary domain that syndicates various subdomains and perfectly intermingles with other domains. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the information management domain from 1970 to 2019. Drawing upon the methodology from statistical text analysis research, this study summarizes the evolution of knowledge in this domain by examining the publication trends as per authors, institutions, countries, etc. Further, this study proposes a probabilistic generative model based on structural topic modeling to understand and extract the latent themes from the research articles related to information management. Furthermore, this study graphically visualizes the variations in the topic prevalences over the period of 1970 to 2019. The results highlight that the most common themes are data management, knowledge management, environmental management, project management, service management, and mobile and web management. The findings also identify themes such as knowledge management, environmental management, project management, and social communication as academic hotspots for future research.}

However, the effort required to push a disease to elimination may come at a vast cost at a time when uncertainty is high. Models currently inform policy discussions on this question, but there are a number of open challenges, particularly given unknown aspects of the pathogen biology, the effectiveness and feasibility of interventions, and the intersecting political, economic, sociological and behavioural complexities for a novel pathogen. In this overview, we detail how models might identify directions for better leveraging or expanding the scope of data available on the pathogen trajectory, for bounding the theoretical context of emergence relative to prospects for elimination, and for framing the larger economic,¬†behavioural and social context that will influence policy decisions and the pathogen‚Äôs outcome.}

With the increased need for the geographically explicit assessment, the geographic information system (GIS) is integrating into LCA as a frontier methodology to spatialize the environmental footprint. This paper reviews a total of 105 publications about GIS-LCA, including 50 methodological studies that are analyzed following the four phases of LCA and 55 applied studies that are classified into different domains. The review shows that although GIS-LCA methodology has certain explorations and practices and a large number of cases are carried out in the energy industry, agricultural sector, urban facility, and waste management, the current knowledge system faces several challenges in spatializing environmental footprint. In this case, a universal methodology framework of GIS-LCA and specific schemes are proposed to address the following issues: (1) how to set up a geographically referenced system in the goal and scope definition phase; (2) how to spatialize life-cycle data and integrate and compute foreground and background data in the inventory analysis phase; (3) how to develop spatialized characterization factors with different requirements on resolution and data availability in the impact assessment phase; and (4) how to uniform the contribution analysis of different zones, unit processes, and elementary flows to visualize spatialized environmental footprint in the interpretation phase. The framework we developed provides preliminary practices and recommendations for spatializing environmental footprint, which lays a foundation to support future work.}

However, data providers usually suffer from the privacy leakage caused by direct data sharing. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a Federated Learning based Secure data Sharing mechanism for IoT, named FL2S. Specifically, to accomplish efficient and secure data sharing, a hierarchical asynchronous federated learning (FL) framework is developed based on the sensitive task decomposition. In addition, to improve data sharing quality, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is utilized to select participants of sufficient computational capabilities and high quality datasets. By integrating task decomposition and participant selection, reliable data sharing is realized by sharing local data models instead of the source data with data privacy preserved. Experiment results show that the proposed FL2S achieves high accuracy in secure data sharing for various IoT applications.}

At present, manufacturing is facing an environment with mass, fragmented, real-time, and multi-scene digital information in the process of product design. To improve the availability of information resources and the efficiency of information reuse as well as to achieve the sharing of production means, the expression of product design information should be optimized in information storage. In addition, a new ecosystem should be built for information increments, making the participants of every link in the process of product design become the contributors of information. Considering the unique aspects of design group individuals, this paper builds a knowledge transfer model that capitalizes on hypercycle theory and proposes the concept of modularizing information carriers and information processing methods. It comprehensively analyses the expression methodology and organizational attributes of product design information and proposes a knowledge transfer carrier model constructed via discretized fragmented semantic information, which is concretely implemented as informative product file labelling. By combining personnel, information carriers and information dissemination networks, this paper provides the functionality and architecture needed to build an information processing platform using social networking software (SNS). Some application scenarios are described by using this processing method for production information; the development process for an automotive air filter is shown as an example. The results of this study suggest that the proposed method is conducive to improving the expressions of product design information and the interactions among participants. The simplicity of the labelling process and the intuitive label content greatly reduce the usability threshold and the losses caused by information gaps, creating a precondition for many types of people to fully participate in the product design information knowledge transfer cycle.}

The speed of energy-transition is often led by innovative startups. Startups with innovative products, services, or value propositions are a key indicator, supporting successful energy-transition. Though, commercial databases cover comprehensive details to understand startup‚Äôs financial activity and stakeholder relation, but without considering their innovation and business activity. Measuring the actual activities of energy startups is pivotal to capture the impact of energy-transition. To put this into perspective, a hybrid approach of data collection combining structured and unstructured data has been proposed in the following work. A list of 240 innovative startups belonging to different categories and technology focus are examined. Furthermore, data-driven analysis is performed over the data collected from multiple sources. Renewable technologies are yet the most preferred technology focus among German entrepreneurs and stakeholders. 24.6% startups are identified in this category followed by 17.5% in energy management and 16.2% in energy storage. The evidence from this study suggests a clear shift in technology and the value proposition of successful innovative startups in Germany. Digitalisation of the energy sector is fostering the development of multi-sided digital platform driven business models. The result suggested that 8.0% of startups have implemented purely platform based services while 15.7% are experimenting with platform business models along with traditional business to business (B2B) and business to customer (B2C) business models. Findings could guide policymakers and federal agencies to provide a vision for future technology and business model adaptation in the German energy sector.}

In the process of computations the data is connected with semantic characteristics that describe the channel of computations, which can be considered as a method of semantic data enrichment. The system of information channels as a whole can be considered as an information graph describing the structuring of the processed data. The information graph supports the data model in the form of a network, the framework of which are objects and the relationships between them. The paper proposes language tools for determining the information graph and interpretation tools that provide practical computations. The set of information channels that make up the information graph can be considered as a low-level tool for data enrichment. The paper studies the possibility of determining tools of higher level. An applicative type language is proposed for defining information graphs, the syntax and semantics of the language are specified. The proposed language can be considered as an intermediate level tool for defining semantics. A procedure is proposed for compiling the language into a low-level construct, preserving the semantics of the language. The supporting system for the proposed computing system includes a low-level language interpreter, as well as an intermediate-level language compiler into a low-level language. The supporting system is implemented in an applicative programming environment. Some elements of the supporting system were tested when developing applied information systems in the field of jurisprudence.}

We developed a framework that identifies and amplifies synergies between data analysts and domain professionals instead of taking one of them (i.e. data analytics) at the centre of the analytical process. The framework combines the often-cited CRISP-DM framework with a knowledge creation framework. The resulting framework is used in a data science project at a Dutch inspectorate that seeks to use data for risk-based inspection. The findings show first support of our framework. They also show that whereas more complex models have a higher predictive power, simpler models are sometimes preferred as they have the potential to create more synergies between inspectors and data analyst. Another issue driven by the integrated framework is about who of the involved actors should own the predictive model: data analysts or inspectors.}

This paper aims to identify feature reduction techniques based on discrete approaches such as euclidean distance using dot products on vibration data samples from accelerometers fitted on bearings. In this limited experimentation, the procured dataset by this approach is considerably smaller in size as compared to the actual complete data, and with comparable results in prediction models, it can be used as a smaller representation of a sensor timeline. The results based on different models show that such reductions can be considered in building IoT applications in industries based on sensors.}

This study developed spatial models to map Pb concentrations in urban topsoil using proximal and remote sensing data. Proximal sensing reflectance spectra (350‚Äì2500¬†nm) of soils were pre-processed and used to calculate the principal components as landscape factors to represent the soil properties. Other landscape factors, including vegetation and land-use factors, were extracted from time-sequential Landsat images. Two hybrid statistical approaches, regression kriging (RK) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), were adopted to establish prediction models using the landscape factors. The results indicated that the use of landscape factors derived from combined remote and proximal sensing data improved the prediction of Pb concentrations compared with useing these data individually. GWR obtained better results than RK for predicting soil Pb concentration. Thus, joint proximal and remote sensing provides timely, easily accessible, and suitable data for extracting landscape factors.}

Cities are promoting bicycling for transportation as an antidote to increased traffic congestion, obesity and related health issues, and air pollution. However, both research and practice have been stalled by lack of data on bicycling volumes, safety, infrastructure, and public attitudes. New technologies such as GPS-enabled smartphones, crowdsourcing tools, and social media are changing the potential sources for bicycling data. However, many of the developments are coming from data science and it can be difficult evaluate the strengths and limitations of crowdsourced data. In this narrative review we provide an overview and critique of crowdsourced data that are being used to fill gaps and advance bicycling behaviour and safety knowledge. We assess crowdsourced data used to map ridership (fitness, bike share, and GPS/accelerometer data), assess safety (web-map tools), map infrastructure (OpenStreetMap), and track attitudes (social media). For each category of data, we discuss the challenges and opportunities they offer for researchers and practitioners. Fitness app data can be used to model spatial variation in bicycling ridership volumes, and GPS/accelerometer data offer new potential to characterise route choice and origin-destination of bicycling trips; however, working with these data requires a high level of training in data science. New sources of safety and near miss data can be used to address underreporting and increase predictive capacity but require grassroots promotion and are often best used when combined with official reports. Crowdsourced bicycling infrastructure data can be timely and facilitate comparisons across multiple cities; however, such data must be assessed for consistency in route type labels. Using social media, it is possible to track reactions to bicycle policy and infrastructure changes, yet linking attitudes expressed on social media platforms with broader populations is a challenge. New data present opportunities for improving our understanding of bicycling and supporting decision making towards transportation options that are healthy and safe for all. However, there are challenges, such as who has data access and how data crowdsourced tools are funded, protection of individual privacy, representativeness of data and impact of biased data on equity in decision making, and stakeholder capacity to use data given the requirement for advanced data science skills. If cities are to benefit from these new data, methodological developments and tools and training for end-users will need to track with the momentum of crowdsourced data.}

Despite a growing body of research into both Artificial intelligence and mental health inpatient flow issues, few studies adequately combine the two. This review summarises findings in the fields of AI in psychiatry and patient flow from the past 5 years, finds links and identifies gaps for future research.
Methods
The OVID database was used to access Embase and Medline. Top journals such as JAMA, Nature and The Lancet were screened for other relevant studies. Selection bias was limited by strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Research
3,675 papers were identified in March 2020, of which a limited number focused on AI for mental health unit patient flow. After initial screening, 323 were selected and 83 were subsequently analysed. The literature review revealed a wide range of applications with three main themes: diagnosis (33%), prognosis (39%) and treatment (28%). The main themes that emerged from AI in patient flow studies were: readmissions (41%), resource allocation (44%) and limitations (91%). The review extrapolates those solutions and suggests how they could potentially improve patient flow on mental health units, along with challenges and limitations they could face.
Conclusion
Research widely addresses potential uses of AI in mental health, with some focused on its applicability in psychiatric inpatients units, however research rarely discusses improvements in patient flow. Studies investigated various uses of AI to improve patient flow across specialities. This review highlights a gap in research and the unique research opportunity it presents.}

The main characteristic of IoT is the enormous quantity of data created by end-user‚Äôs devices that needs to be processed in a short time in the cloud. The current cloud-computing concept is not efficient to analyze very large data in a very short time and satisfy the users‚Äô requirements. Analyzing the enormous quantity of data by the cloud will take a lot of time, which affects the quality of service (QoS) and negatively influences the IoT applications and the overall network performance. To overcome such challenges, a new architecture called edge computing ‚Äî that allows to decentralize the process of data from the cloud to the network edge has been proposed to solve the problems occurred by using the cloud computing approach. Furthermore, edge computing supports IoT applications that require a short response time and consequently enhances the consumption of energy, resource utilization, etc. Motivated by the extensive research efforts in the edge computing and IoT applications, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of edge and fog computing research in the IoT. We investigate the role of cloud, fog, and edge computing in the IoT environment. Subsequently, we cover in detail, different IoT use cases with edge and fog computing, the task scheduling in edge computing, the merger of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) with edge computing, security and privacy efforts.

Advances in technological developments are proving to be a game changer for improving maintenance strategies and practices. However, several challenges related to the lack of adequate managerial aspects, and adoption of wrong approaches to this transformation hinder its success. Research has shown that technology alone is not sufficient for organizations to ensure the success of their digitalization attempts. Therefore, the aim of this research is to adopt a holistic approach to identify, evaluate and rank a comprehensive list of the various influencing variables, multifaceted in nature, that drive the success of maintenance DT initiatives. To that end, the authors solicited the different success factors based on a systematic literature review, then conducted a purification phase of these enablers and categorized them. Subsequently, a hybrid reactive Delphi approach, combined with AHP method, was adopted to evaluate and rank the success factors and their corresponding clusters through a panel of 17 highly qualified experts. The verified final list includes 41 factors mapped into 10 categories. The clusters are ranked according to their relative level of importance, and normalized weights are attributed to their factors. In particular, ‚ÄúDigital strategy - strategic alignment‚Äù cluster ranked highest followed by ‚ÄúTop management and leadership skills‚Äù then ‚ÄúOrganizational development and change management‚Äù.

This, however, creates problems and challenges for the individual with respect to their privacy and identity. In this paper, the Mondrian multidimensional anonymization method was developed and improved for satisfaction of the l-diversity privacy model, and it has been presented in a distributed fashion within the Apache Spark framework. Since one of the major challenges in data privacy is the tradeoff between privacy and data utility, the presented method focuses on information loss and classifier evaluation criteria. Therefore, the cut dimension was selected using the coefficient of variation and information gain criteria, and the cut points were chosen dynamically, which led to a decrease in the information loss parameter and an improvement in the classifier performance evaluation criteria such as accuracy and FMeasure compared to the previous algorithms in the literature. The processing speed is 100 times higher in Spark than in the Hadoop framework. Consequently, the proposed method was presented in a distributed fashion based on RDDs programming within Apache Spark framework. This will resolve the problem of speed in large-scale data anonymization as it exists in the previous Hadoop-based algorithms. The results of the experiments performed on the numerical datasets demonstrate the improvements made by the proposed method.}

First, AIS data is preprocessed and trajectory reconstructed to restore the ship historical navigation state, and a ship encounter identification model is constructed according to the encounter characteristics; Second, a two-stage collision avoidance behavior extraction algorithm is formed to build a behavior knowledge base, and the scenario similarity model is constructed to measure and match similar scenarios based on ship position, motion tendency and collision risk. Then, the Delaunay Triangulation Network is used to fuse ship trajectories of similar scenario to form the collision avoidance path. Finally, a case study is performed using the real AIS data outside Ningbo-Zhoushan Port waters, China, and the effectiveness of the planned path is verified by setting the head-on and crossing situations and comparison between the planned and real paths. Results indicate that the proposed model can extract the ship collision avoidance behavior accurately, and the planned path can ensure navigation safety.}

abstract = {In recent years a substantial literature has emerged concerning bias, discrimination, and fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Connecting this work to existing legal non-discrimination frameworks is essential to create tools and methods that are practically useful across divergent legal regimes. While much work has been undertaken from an American legal perspective, comparatively little has mapped the effects and requirements of EU law. This Article addresses this critical gap between legal, technical, and organisational notions of algorithmic fairness. Through analysis of EU non-discrimination law and jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and national courts, we identify a critical incompatibility between European notions of discrimination and existing work on algorithmic and automated fairness. A clear gap exists between statistical measures of fairness as embedded in myriad fairness toolkits and governance mechanisms and the context-sensitive, often intuitive and ambiguous discrimination metrics and evidential requirements used by the ECJ; we refer to this approach as ‚Äúcontextual equality.‚Äù This Article makes three contributions. First, we review the evidential requirements to bring a claim under EU non-discrimination law. Due to the disparate nature of algorithmic and human discrimination, the EU's current requirements are too contextual, reliant on intuition, and open to judicial interpretation to be automated. Many of the concepts fundamental to bringing a claim, such as the composition of the disadvantaged and advantaged group, the severity and type of harm suffered, and requirements for the relevance and admissibility of evidence, require normative or political choices to be made by the judiciary on a case-by-case basis. We show that automating fairness or non-discrimination in Europe may be impossible because the law, by design, does not provide a static or homogenous framework suited to testing for discrimination in AI systems. Second, we show how the legal protection offered by non-discrimination law is challenged when AI, not humans, discriminate. Humans discriminate due to negative attitudes (e.g. stereotypes, prejudice) and unintentional biases (e.g. organisational practices or internalised stereotypes) which can act as a signal to victims that discrimination has occurred. Equivalent signalling mechanisms and agency do not exist in algorithmic systems. Compared to traditional forms of discrimination, automated discrimination is more abstract and unintuitive, subtle, intangible, and difficult to detect. The increasing use of algorithms disrupts traditional legal remedies and procedures for detection, investigation, prevention, and correction of discrimination which have predominantly relied upon intuition. Consistent assessment procedures that define a common standard for statistical evidence to detect and assess prima facie automated discrimination are urgently needed to support judges, regulators, system controllers and developers, and claimants. Finally, we examine how existing work on fairness in machine learning lines up with procedures for assessing cases under EU non-discrimination law. A ‚Äògold standard‚Äô for assessment of prima facie discrimination has been advanced by the European Court of Justice but not yet translated into standard assessment procedures for automated discrimination. We propose ‚Äòconditional demographic disparity‚Äô (CDD) as a standard baseline statistical measurement that aligns with the Court's ‚Äògold standard‚Äô. Establishing a standard set of statistical evidence for automated discrimination cases can help ensure consistent procedures for assessment, but not judicial interpretation, of cases involving AI and automated systems. Through this proposal for procedural regularity in the identification and assessment of automated discrimination, we clarify how to build considerations of fairness into automated systems as far as possible while still respecting and enabling the contextual approach to judicial interpretation practiced under EU non-discrimination law.}

Many different algorithms and heuristics have been investigated to hide sensitive information using the act of transaction deletion based on evolutionary computation techniques, but to date, these algorithms only consider a uniform threshold value for sanitization progress. This technique is not applicable in real-world situations, especially for eHealth based medical datasets. For example, a patient can still be identified if he/she has more confidential information (i.e., symptoms) that cause privacy threats and security leakage in medical applications. In this work, we investigate a unique novel methodology to set varied threshold values that lead to varied lengths of sensitive patterns within a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based framework. As the pattern length increases, a tighter threshold manifests to provide better protection of sensitive information that can avoid individual patients to be identified in eHealth datasets. Two GA-based models are developed for data sanitization using record deletion techniques. The experimental results are conducted and compared with the traditional Evolutionary Computation (EC)-based PPDM approaches and the results showed that the designed methods offer greater protection than previous methods in terms of side effects. Therefore, the designed models are effective to hide sensitive information in medical situations that can be used in real-world scenarios.}

Due to its superiority over conventional geophone and detector, DFOS tool possesses great potential to sense geofluid injection-induced small disturbances in deep subsurface.

Given the increasing attentions of optical sensing, we present a first-hand review of DFOS categories, sensing principles, and advantages for GCS related investigations from both laboratory and field scales. We discuss in detail three typical DFOS-deployed GCS projects and explore the implicit findings to guide subsequent GCS field applications.

abstract = {Industry 4.0 has raised the expectations on productivity, automation, and resource efficiency of manufacturing systems. This paper proposes a digital twin framework for the simulation and optimization of production lines and cells that can be used in the design and operation stages. The framework is supported by an architecture that connects manufacturing and machine tool data (digital shadow), the discrete event simulation model and the optimization engine, allowing for a variety of functionalities to plan and manage the production system. A use case is provided to demonstrate this framework, implemented in an automated line for the manufacturing of railway axles.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health. WHO emphasises the need for countries to monitor antibiotic consumption to combat AMR. Many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack surveillance capacity; we aimed to use multiple data sources and statistical models to estimate global antibiotic consumption.
Methods
In this spatial modelling study, we used individual-level data from household surveys to inform a Bayesian geostatistical model of antibiotic usage in children (aged <5 years) with lower respiratory tract infections in LMICs. Antibiotic consumption data were obtained from multiple sources, including IQVIA, WHO, and the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-Net). The estimates of the antibiotic usage model were used alongside sociodemographic and health covariates to inform a model of total antibiotic consumption in LMICs. This was combined with a single model of antibiotic consumption in high-income countries to produce estimates of antibiotic consumption covering 204 countries and 19 years.
Findings
We analysed 209 surveys done between 2000 and 2018, covering 284‚Äà045 children with lower respiratory tract infections. We identified large national and subnational variations of antibiotic usage in LMICs, with the lowest levels estimated in sub-Saharan Africa and the highest in eastern Europe and central Asia. We estimated a global antibiotic consumption rate of 14¬∑3 (95% uncertainty interval 13¬∑2‚Äì15¬∑6) defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 population per day in 2018 (40¬∑2 [37¬∑2‚Äì43¬∑7] billion DDD), an increase of 46% from 9¬∑8 (9¬∑2‚Äì10¬∑5) DDD per 1000 per day in 2000. We identified large spatial disparities, with antibiotic consumption rates varying from 5¬∑0 (4¬∑8‚Äì5¬∑3) DDD per 1000 per day in the Philippines to 45¬∑9 DDD per 1000 per day in Greece in 2018. Additionally, we present trends in consumption of different classes of antibiotics for selected Global Burden of Disease study regions using the IQVIA, WHO, and ESAC-net input data. We identified large increases in the consumption of fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins in North Africa and Middle East, and south Asia.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates antibiotic usage and consumption data and uses geostatistical modelling techniques to estimate antibiotic consumption for 204 countries from 2000 to 2018. Our analysis identifies both high rates of antibiotic consumption and a lack of access to antibiotics, providing a benchmark for future interventions.

abstract = {Vessel tracking data help study the potential impact of fisheries on biodiversity and produce risk assessments. Existing workflows process vessel tracks to identify fishing activity and integrate information on species vulnerability. However, there are significant data integration challenges across the data sources needed for an integrated impact assessment due to heterogeneous nomenclatures, data accessibility issues, geographical and computational scalability of the processes, and confidentiality and transparency towards decision making authorities. This paper presents an Open Science data integration approach to use vessel tracking data in integrated impact assessments. Our approach combines heterogeneous knowledge sources from fisheries, biodiversity, and environmental observations to infer fishing activity and risks to potentially impacted species. An Open Science e-Infrastructure facilitates access to data sources and maximises the reproducibility of the results and the method's reusability across several application domains. Our method's quality is assessed through three case studies: The first demonstrates cross-dataset consistency by comparing the results obtained from two different vessel data sources. The second performs a temporal pattern analysis of fishing activity and potentially impacted species over time. The third assesses the potential impact of reduced fishing pressure on marine biodiversity and threatened species due to the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. The method is meant to be integrated with other systems through its Open Science-oriented features and can rapidly use new sources of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data. Other systems can use it to (i) classify vessel activity in data-limited scenarios, (ii) identify bycatch species (when catchability data are available), and (iii) study the effects of fisheries on habitats and populations‚Äô growth.}
