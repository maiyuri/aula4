abstract = {Context
Predictive maintenance is a technique for creating a more sustainable, safe, and profitable industry. One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review.
Objective
This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research.
Method
A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed.
Results
This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry.
Conclusion
This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models.}

A prominent hurdle on this path arises from the multiscale, multiphysics, dynamic, and stochastic nature of many manufacturing systems, which motivated many innovations at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and manufacturing sciences. This study reviews recent advances in Mechanistic-AI, defined as a methodology that combines the raw mathematical power of AI methods with mechanism-driven principles and engineering insights. Mechanistic-AI solutions are systematically analyzed for three aspects of manufacturing processes, i.e., modeling, design, and control, with a focus on approaches that can improve data requirements, generalizability, explainability, and capability to handle challenging and heterogeneous manufacturing data. Additionally, we introduce a corpus of cutting-edge Mechanistic-AI methods that have shown to be very promising in other scientific fields but yet to be applied in manufacturing. Finally, gaps in the knowledge and under-explored research directions are identified, such as lack of incorporating manufacturing constraints into AI methods, lack of uncertainty analysis, and limited reproducibility and established benchmarks. This paper shows the immense potential of the Mechanistic-AI to address new problems in manufacturing systems and is expected to drive further advancements in manufacturing and related fields.}

With the development and utilization of marine and other underwater resources, underwater SLAM has become a hot research topic. By focusing on underwater visual SLAM, this paper reviews the basic theories and research progress regarding underwater visual SLAM modules, such as sensors, visual odometry, state optimization and loop closure detection, discusses the challenges faced by underwater visual SLAM, and shares the prospects of underwater visual SLAM. It is found that the traditional underwater visual SLAM based on filtering methods is gradually developing towards optimization-based methods. Underwater visual SLAM presents a diversified trend, and various new methods have emerged. This paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the current status and development trend of underwater visual SLAM, while offering help for collecting underwater vehicles intelligence.}

The paper discusses recent advances for ethical AI and suggests a pathway from ethical norms towards standards. As it is argued, taking the responsible AI approach is promising when tackling the main ethic-related challenges of Cyber-Physical Production Systems. We expose a number of dilemmas to be resolved so that AI systems incorporated in CPPS cause no damages either in humans, equipment or in the environment and increase the trust in the users of current and future AI technologies.}

The CIM helps in the search for information on future demands, providing a holistic view of the city. However, the absence of a full application and an established concept has been observed in the literature. Considering this, a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis was conducted, resulting in 80 articles that composed the final analysis. We identified five recurring topics in the articles, the most important of the CIM, and discussed them in depth. We found a direction towards the CIM concept: the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM), geographic information system (GIS), and a complete and up-to-date urban database, which enables analysis and simulation. The research concluded that a major effort will still be needed to establish the CIM, and its full implementation also depends on the dissemination of knowledge and demonstration of the tool's potential.}

The development of new biological approaches over the past decade has led to a decrease in cancer morbidity and mortality but does not produce significant results, so prevention and early detection are substantial steps to reduce the case of cancerous disease. Proteomics and network-based approaches have emerged as powerful methods for identifying important proteins of cancer, which play an important role in cancer development. The identification and detection of these proteins can be helpful for the diagnosis of oral cancer at its early stages. Cancer-related proteins and signalling pathways also play a vital role in cancer development. The field of cancer systems biology has achieved great success in understanding the oncogenic signalling pathway involved in the development of oral cancer. Recent advancements in systems biology approaches based on high-throughput technologies are beneficial for identifying oral cancer. Systems biology-based approaches examine the expression of some critical genes and proteins that are involved in cancer genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. Molecular markers derived from systems biology techniques are useful for understanding the molecular and biological mechanisms of oral cancer development and progression. In this review article, we are trying to provide a systematic overview of the current systems biology approaches toward identifying protein–protein base interactions in oral cancer genes and proteins. The system biology approach uses various database sets and tools that can play an essential role in identifying oral cancer at its early stages and providing a novel approach to oral cancer treatment.}

COVID-19 has been designated an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has placed a tremendous burden on nearly all countries, especially those with weak health systems. However, Deep Learning (DL) has been applied in several applications and many types of detection applications in the medical field, including thyroid diagnosis, lung nodule recognition, fetal localization, and detection of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, various clinical imaging sources, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT), make DL a perfect technique to tackle the epidemic of COVID-19. Inspired by this fact, a considerable amount of research has been done. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been used in this study to discover, assess, and integrate findings from relevant studies. DL techniques used in COVID-19 have also been categorized into seven main distinct categories as Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoders, and hybrid approaches. Then, the state-of-the-art studies connected to DL techniques and applications for health problems with COVID-19 have been highlighted. Moreover, many issues and problems associated with DL implementation for COVID-19 have been addressed, which are anticipated to stimulate more investigations to control the prevalence and disaster control in the future. According to the findings, most papers are assessed using characteristics such as accuracy, delay, robustness, and scalability. Meanwhile, other features are underutilized, such as security and convergence time. Python is also the most commonly used language in papers, accounting for 75% of the time. According to the investigation, 37.83% of applications have identified chest CT/chest X-ray images for patients.}

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market. Recognizing the importance of AI, this study was conducted on seven different energetics systems and their variety of applications, including: i) electricity production; ii) power delivery; iii) electric distribution networks; iv) energy storage; v) energy saving, new energy materials, and devices; vi) energy efficiency and nanotechnology; and vii) energy policy, and economics. The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently. Moreover, policy recommendations, research opportunities, and how industry 4.0 will improve sustainability have been briefly described.}

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the complexity of professional mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) information, it is challenging to apply current common deep learning IE methods to the MEP domain. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a rule-based approach for MEP IE task, including a “snowball” strategy to collect large-scale MEP corpora, a suffix-based matching algorithm on text segments for named entity recognition (NER), and a dependency-path-based matching algorithm on dependency tree for relationship extraction (RE). 2 ideas called “meta linking” and “path filtering” for RE are proposed as well, to discover the out-of-pattern entities/relationships as many as possible. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, 65 MB MEP corpora have been collected as input of the proposed approach and an MEP semantic web which consists of 15,978 entities and 65,110 relationship triples established, with an accuracy of 81% to entities and 75% to relationship triples, respectively. A comparison experiment between classical deep learning models and the proposed rule-based approach was carried out, illustrating that the performance of our method is 37% and 49% better than the selected deep learning NER and RE models, respectively, in the aspect of extraction precision.}

We analyzed 100 articles to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on how GANs are currently applied to solve challenging tasks in the built environment. Our results show that: (i) GANs are replacing older methods in some problems and setting state-of-the-art performances; (ii) GANs are opening new frontiers in previously overlooked problems, such as automatically generating spatially accurate floorplan layouts; (iii) GANs can be applied to different scales in the built environment, from entire cities to neighborhoods and buildings; and (iv) GANs are being used in a variety of problems and data types, from remote sensing data augmentation, vector data generation, spatio-temporal data privacy protection, to building design generation. In total, there are 26 unique application domains enabled by GANs; (v) however, one common challenge in this field currently is the lack of high-quality datasets curated specifically for problems in the built environment. With more data in the future, GANs could potentially produce even better results than today.}

abstract = {Excellent water quality (WQ) is an indispensable element in ensuring sustainable water resource development. It is highly associated with the 3rd (good health and well-being), the 6th (clean water and sanitation), and the 14th (life below water) listed items of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Thus, policymakers have always been seeking strategies to manage WQ efficiently. Recent advancements in computational technologies have created enthusiasm for using artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL), in WQ management. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of DL in WQ management, covering developments from 2011 to 2022, in maintaining the temporal relevance of this review. In this paper, a brief description of different variants of DL models, including the recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), etc, are presented. The distinct approaches in the optimization, hybridization and relevant data pre-processing techniques suitable for the DL models, are also discussed. This is the first review paper that extensively discusses the application of DL models for forecasting WQ parameters in various water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, coastal areas, etc. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing that revolutionized DL approaches in WQ management are also presented. This review paper serves as a complete easy guideline for the researchers in the field of DL-based WQ management. The findings of this review paper may help policymakers to enhance their decision-making process with the hope that regional environmental welfare can drastically be improved.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is finding several applications in healthcare settings. The aim of our review is to report evidence about AI application in obstetrics. Through a narrative review of the literature, we described AI use in different obstetric areas: prenatal diagnosis, fetal heart monitoring, prediction and management of pregnancy-related complications (preeclampsia, preterm birth, gestational diabetes mellitus and placenta accreta spectrum), and labor. AI seems to be a promising tool to help clinicians in daily clinical activity. The main advantages that emerged from this review are related to the reduction of inter- and intra-operator variability, time reduction of procedures and improvement of overall diagnostic performance. However, nowadays, the diffusion of these systems in routine clinical practice raises several issues. Reported evidence are still very limited and further studies are needed to confirm clinical applicability of AI. Moreover, a better training of clinicians that are designed to use these systems should be ensured and evidence-based guidelines regarding this topic should be produced, in order to enhance the strengths of artificial systems and minimize their limits.}

With rising popularity of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques combined with their unique ability to uncover connections between large amounts of diverse data, we conducted a PRISMA systematic review to investigate advances in ID prediction for human and animal diseases using ML and DL. This review included the type of IDs modeled, ML and DL techniques utilized, geographical distribution, prediction tasks performed, input features utilized, spatial and temporal scales, error metrics used, computational efficiency, uncertainty quantification, and missing data handling methods. Among 237 relevant articles published between January 2001 and May 2021, highly contagious diseases in humans were most often represented, including COVID-19 (37.1%), influenza/influenza-like illnesses (9.3%), dengue (8.9%), and malaria (5.1%). Out of 37 diseases identified, 51.4% were zoonotic, 37.8% were human-only, and 8.1% were animal-only, with only 1.6% economically significant, non-zoonotic livestock diseases. Despite the number of zoonoses, 86.5% of articles modeled humans whereas only a few articles (5.1%) contained more than one host species. Eastern Asia (32.5%), North America (17.7%), and Southern Asia (13.1%) were the most represented locations. Frequent approaches included tree-based ML (38.4%) and feed-forward neural networks (26.6%). Articles predicted temporal incidence (66.7%), disease risk (38.0%), and/or spatial movement (31.2%). Less than 10% of studies addressed uncertainty quantification, computational efficiency, and missing data, which are essential to operational use and deployment. This study highlights trends and gaps in ML and DL for ID prediction, providing guidelines for future works to better support biopreparedness and response. To fully utilize ML and DL for improved ID forecasting, models should include the full disease ecology in a One-Health context, important food and agricultural diseases, underrepresented hotspots, and important metrics required for operational deployment.}

On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) based techniques are playing a major role in effective utilization of the computing resources and offering Quality of Service (QoS). Based on the customer’s application requirements, several cloud computing-based paradigms i.e., edge computing, fog computing, mist computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), cybertwin, and industry 4.0 have been evolved. These paradigms collaborate to offer customer-centric services with the backend of cloud server/data center. In brief, cloud computing has been emerged with respect to the above-mentioned paradigms to enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) for the users. In particular, ML techniques are the motivating factor to backend the cloud for emerging paradigms, and ML techniques are essentially enhancing the usages of these paradigms by solving several problems of scheduling, resource provisioning, resource allocation, load balancing, Virtual Machine (VM) migration, offloading, VM mapping, energy optimization, workload prediction, device monitoring, etc. However, a comprehensive survey focusing on multi-paradigm integrated architectures, technical and analytical aspects of these paradigms, and the role of ML techniques in emerging cloud computing paradigms are still missing, and this domain needs to be explored. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first survey that investigates the emerging cloud computing paradigms integration considering the most dominating problem-solving technology i.e., ML. This survey article provides a comprehensive summary and structured layout for the vast research on ML techniques in the emerging cloud computing paradigm. This research presents a detailed literature review of emerging cloud computing paradigms: cloud, edge, fog, mist, IoT, SDN, cybertwin, and industry 4.0 (IIoT) along with their integration using ML. To carry out this study, majorly, the last five years (2017-21) articles are explored and analyzed thoroughly to understand the emerging integrated architectures, the comparative study on several attributes, and recent trends.

For instance, data provenance, which records the origins of data, and the record of data usage, update and processing can be introduced to trace malicious vulnerabilities. Thus, data provenance process makes it easy to monitor the sources and causes of any problems in cloud computing. However, data provenance is one of the most prominent drawbacks in cloud storage. Despite many studies, a full assessment of data provenance in cloud forensics is still missing from the literature, especially in wireless sensor networks, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), security and privacy. Importantly, one of the major challenges in data provenance is “how to reduce the complexity of evidence.“ That is, ensuring volatile data is captured before being overwritten. Hence, this study presents a survey of recent data provenance problems in cloud computing, provenance taxonomy, and security issues. It also, discusses how volatile data can be captured before being overwritten and then helps identify current provenance limitations and future directions for further study. More also, it examined how data is collected as evidence for digital crime in a real-world scenario. Furthermore, future work in digital provenance for cloud forensics, wireless sensor network, IoT, and blockchain is recommended.}

RL may help to address some of the criticisms leveled against crop management decision support systems (DSS): it is an interactive, geared towards action, contextual tool to evaluate series of crop operations faced with uncertainties. A review of RL use for crop management DSS reveals a limited number of contributions. We profile key prospects for a human-centered, real-world, interactive RL-based system to face tomorrow’s agricultural decisions, and theoretical and ongoing practical challenges that may explain its current low uptake. We argue that a joint research effort from the RL and agronomy communities is necessary to explore RL’s full potential.}

The International Malnutrition Task Force (IMTF) of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences was set up as an advocacy and capacity-building initiative in 2005 at a time when malnutrition contributed to 60% of deaths among children under-five, and when a reduction in under-five mortality by two-thirds had been set as Millennium Development Goal 4.
Findings and conclusions
By forging partnerships through regional networks of academics, and linking with international agencies and non-governmental organizations, IMTF was able to increase awareness of the urgent need to address the prevention and treatment of child malnutrition. With modest funding, but a common purpose, partners initiated capacity building efforts to reduce high inpatient mortality rates among children admitted with severe malnutrition. In all regions, these initiatives catalysed scaling-up of the WHO 10-step treatment guidelines, resulting in substantial improvements in child survival. Many lessons were learned during this process including the importance of operational research, supervision and teamwork, political commitment, and the potential of eLearning. By establishing alliances between academics, health professionals, policy makers, and national and international paediatric and nutrition societies through a Task Force, we suggest that similar benefits might accrue in other fields, including childhood cancer and school feeding.}

Aortic dissection confers high mortality and morbidity rates despite advances in treatment, impacts quality of life, and contributes immense burden to the healthcare system globally. Efforts to prevent aortic dissection through screening and management of modifiable risk factors and early detection of aneurysms should incorporate genomic information, as it is integral to stratifying risk. However, effective integration of genomic-guided risk assessment into clinical practice will require addressing implementation barriers that currently permeate our healthcare systems. The Aortic Dissection Collaborative was established to define aortic dissection research priorities through patient engagement. Using a collaborative patient-centered feedback model, our Genomic Medicine Working Group identified related research priorities that could be investigated by pragmatic interventional studies aimed at aortic dissection prevention, utilization of genomic information to improve patient outcomes, and access to genomic medicine services. Further research is also needed to identify the genomic, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors that contribute to aortic dissection so these data can be incorporated into future comparative effectiveness studies to prevent aortic dissection.}

abstract = {The provision of water and sanitation services is a key challenge worldwide. The size, complexity, and critical nature of the water and wastewater infrastructure providing such services make the planning and management of these systems extremely difficult. Following the digital revolution in many areas of our lives, the water sector has begun to benefit from digital transformation. Effective utilization of remotely sensed weather and soil moisture data for more efficient irrigation (i.e., for food production), better detection of anomalies and faults in pipe networks using artificial intelligence, the use of nature-inspired optimization to improve the management and planning of systems, and greater use of digital twins and robotics all exhibit great potential to change and improve the ways in which complex water systems are managed. However, there are additional risks associated with these developments, including—but not limited to—cybersecurity, incorrect use, and overconfidence in the capability and accuracy of digital solutions and automation. This paper identifies key advances in digital technology that have found application in the water sector, and applies forensic engineering principles to failures that have been experienced in industries further ahead with automation and digital transformation. By identifying what went wrong with new digital technologies that might have contributed to high-profile accidents in the car and aircraft industries (e.g., Tesla self-driving cars and the Boeing 737 MAX), it is possible to identify similar risks in the water sector, learn from them, and prevent future failures. The key findings show that: ① Automation will require “humans in the loop”; ② human operators must be fully aware of the technology and trained to use it; ③ fallback manual intervention should be available in case of technology malfunctioning; ④ while redundant sensors may be costly, they reduce the risks due to erroneous sensor readings; ⑤ cybersecurity risks must be considered; and ⑥ ethics issues have to be considered, given the increasing automation and interconnectedness of water systems. These findings also point to major research areas related to digital transformation in the water sector.}

abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) techniques to metal-based nanomaterials has contributed greatly to understanding the interaction of nanoparticles, properties prediction, and new materials discovery. However, the prediction accuracy and efficiency of distinctive ML algorithms differ with different metal-based nanomaterials problems. This, alongside the high dimensionality and nonlinearity of available datasets in metal-based nanomaterials problems, makes it imperative to review recent advances in the implementation of ML techniques for these kinds of problems. In addition to understanding the applicability of different ML algorithms to various kinds of metal-based nanomaterials problems, it is hoped that this work will help facilitate understanding and promote interest in this emerging and less explored area of materials informatics. The scope of this review covers the introduction of metal-based nanomaterials, several techniques used in generating datasets for training ML models, feature engineering techniques used in nanomaterials-machine learning applications, and commonly applied ML algorithms. Then, we present the recent advances in ML applications to metal-based nanomaterials, with emphasis on the procedure and efficiency of algorithms used for such applications. In the concluding section, we identify the most common and efficient algorithms for distinctive property predictions. The common problems encountered in ML applications for metal-based nanoinformatics were mentioned. Finally, we propose suitable solutions and future outlooks for various challenges in metal-based nanoinformatics research.}

Hence, research and practice have developed hybrid socio-technical systems of data mining and expert knowledge to identify competitors early on. To better understand the ergonomic design of such systems and how to integrate them in strategic management driven by artificial intelligence, we engaged in a systematic literature review to summarize the field and guide future research. We identified use cases, data source types, and algorithms that have been developed in 40 publications between 2002 and 2019. We found that existing approaches neglect to identify indirect and potential competitors at the periphery of a company’s vision. Such a blind spot exposes companies to increased risks of disruption, given that disruptive change often starts in the form of weak signals. Furthermore, we recommend using artificial intelligence to advance search strategies, allow document collection updates, and harmonize multiple data source types.}

abstract = {Summary
The widespread use of smartphones and the internet has enabled self-monitoring and more hybrid-care models. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated remote monitoring, including in the heterogenous and often vulnerable group of patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Home monitoring in ILD has the potential to improve access to specialist care, reduce the burden on health-care systems, improve quality of life for patients, identify acute and chronic disease worsening, guide treatment decisions, and simplify clinical trials. Home spirometry has been used in ILD for several years and studies with other devices (such as pulse oximeters, activity trackers, and cough monitors) have emerged. At the same time, challenges have surfaced, including technical, analytical, and implementational issues. In this Series paper, we provide an overview of experiences with home monitoring in ILD, address the challenges and limitations for both care and research, and provide future perspectives.

In light of the resource and knowledge intensiveness of this often multi-year process, this study draws on paradox theory to identify the main organizational tensions emerging and persisting during the Industry 4.0 transformation of companies in a two-step approach. First, a systematic review of 73 academic papers on organizational challenges in Industry 4.0 adoption is conducted that summarizes 35 key challenges. Second, from these challenges a conceptual framework is built that illustrates the main tensions in Industry 4.0 implementation. The identified organizational tensions are categorized according to the learning, organizing, belonging, and performing categories proposed by the paradox theory. Moreover, resolution strategies to address these tensions have been drawn from the reviewed literature. These strategies are presented and linked to the individual tensions. Finally, tensions and resolution strategies were preliminary validated by a group of Industry 4.0 professionals during a workshop. As a result, the findings provide 23 tensions and 18 related resolution strategies illustrating how organizations can address to competing demands simultaneously when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies and thus raise their competitiveness and performance. Based on these results, the article discusses implications for operations management practitioners that can use the proposed framework to inform their strategies and decisions in Industry 4.0 implementation. Moreover, policymakers can adopt the results to develop focussed support actions for driving the Industry 4.0 transition. Finally, four main avenues for future research and implications for operations management scholars are provided.}

Enterprise, industries, and critical infrastructure rely on CPPS. As a result of their critical importance, they are prime targets for cyberattacks aimed at disrupting their operations. CPPS are mission-critical, attacks on them can have disastrous consequences. CPPS security can be improved by utilizing testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover threats, develop sustainable cybersecurity solutions, and evaluate grid operation in physical fault-induced or cyberattack scenarios. This Part-II paper reviews the CPPS testbeds in the view of the testbed type, targeted research area, CPPS domain, and communication infrastructure with the fusion of physical and cyber systems. Furthermore, this review gives an outline, framework, and application-based assessment of various industry and institutional testbeds. The design process of CPPS testbeds is reviewed first in this paper(Part-II), followed by description of the classification of CPPS testbeds for cyberattacks and sustainable cybersecurity analysis in CPPS. A brief overview of CPPS testbeds in various academic institutions, R&D laboratories, and industries are provided and each testbed is evaluated using the eleven proposed assessment criteria. Finally, the current issues and future research directions for CPPS testbeds to develop a secure and sustainable electric power grid are discussed. The Part-I paper reviewed the major research areas in CPPS, the importance of cyberattack testbeds, and long-term cybersecurity analysis in CPPS, as well as the NIST framework for CPS, CPPS domains and research areas.}

There is currently no study that provides a comprehensive picture of the current research landscape that can inform different groups who need to capitalise on social media for disaster recovery. The present study aims to address this research gap by conducting a systematic literature review of social media use in disaster recovery. The review analyses the relevant studies to identify any temporal variations in research activity, the social media platforms most frequently used in disaster recovery, their patterns of use by type of disaster as well as the geographical locations where the studies have focused. Importantly, the paper identifies and summarises research findings relating to social media use in various aspects of disaster recovery, including (1) donations and financial support, (2) solidarity and social cohesion, (3) post-disaster reconstruction and infrastructure services, (4) socioeconomic and physical wellbeing, (5) information support, (6) mental health and emotional support, and (7) business & economic activities. We envisage that this comprehensive review will support the disaster risk reduction community with the requisite knowledge to better explore social media for disaster recovery. Similarly, future research may find the study helpful for understanding the state of knowledge and identifying research gaps around social media use for disaster recovery.}

Benchmarking and monitoring of urban design and transport features is crucial to achieving local and international health and sustainability goals. However, most urban indicator frameworks use coarse spatial scales that either only allow between-city comparisons, or require expensive, technical, local spatial analyses for within-city comparisons. This study developed a reusable, open-source urban indicator computational framework using open data to enable consistent local and global comparative analyses. We show this framework by calculating spatial indicators—for 25 diverse cities in 19 countries—of urban design and transport features that support health and sustainability. We link these indicators to cities’ policy contexts, and identify populations living above and below critical thresholds for physical activity through walking. Efforts to broaden participation in crowdsourcing data and to calculate globally consistent indicators are essential for planning evidence-informed urban interventions, monitoring policy effects, and learning lessons from peer cities to achieve health, equity, and sustainability goals.}

The findings revealed minimal application of DTT in the MiC prefab transportation phase and the potentiality of blockchain and other integrated DTT for use in MiC projects. Globally, Canada, China, and the USA are the leading countries that have applied DTT in MiC projects. Also, simulation, building information modelling (BIM), and optimization algorithms are the most frequently deployed DTT in modular construction. This study has provided valuable insights into the digital technologies adopted in MiC projects and potential areas for its future use in modular construction.}

The performance and efficiency of EVs are subject to the precise estimation of SOC, SOH, and RUL in BMS which enhances the battery reliability, safety, and longevity. However, the estimation of SOC, SOH, and RUL is challenging due to the battery capacity degradation and varying environmental conditions. Recently, deep learning (DL) has received wide attention for battery SOC, SOH, and RUL estimation due to the accessibility of a vast amount of data, large storage volume, and powerful computing processors. Nevertheless, the application of DL in SOC, SOH, and RUL estimation for EVs is still limited. Therefore, the novelty of this paper is to deliver a comprehensive review of DL-enabled SOC, SOH, and RUL estimation for BMS, focusing on methods, implementations, strengths, weaknesses, issues, accuracy, and contributions. Moreover, this study explores the numerous important implementation factors of DL methods concerning data type, features, size, preprocessing, algorithm operation, functions, hyperparameter adjustments, and performance evaluation. Additionally, the review explores various limitations and challenges of DL in BMS related to battery, algorithm, and operational issues. Finally, future opportunities and prospects are delivered that would support the EV engineers and automotive industries to establish an accurate and robust DL-based SOC, SOH, and RUL estimation technique towards smart BMS in future sustainable EV applications.}

Crop water status based on three pre-established values (severe, mild, and no stress) is the essential datum needed to implement optimised irrigation scheduling based on deficit irrigation. Currently however, its calculation is a repetitive, tedious, and technical process carried out by hand. This communication presents a novel system based on continuous measurements of leaf turgor pressure to assess the crop water status when deficit irrigation strategies are being applied and/or to optimise irrigation scheduling in water scarcity scenarios. To this end, a novel expert system based on machine learning, together with an IoT infrastructure based on continuous measurements of leaf turgor pressure, is able to predict the citrus crop ψstem with a 99% F1 score. Thus, crop irrigation strategies involving irrigation-restriction cycles can be applied based on stem water potential.}

A number of established computational tools have been proposed to predict pAs from diverse genomic data. Here we provided an exhaustive overview of computational approaches for predicting pAs from DNA sequences, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Particularly, we examined several representative tools using RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and put forward operable suggestions on how to assess the reliability of pAs predicted by different tools. We also proposed practical guidelines on choosing appropriate methods applicable to diverse scenarios. Moreover, we discussed in depth the challenges in improving the performance of pA prediction and benchmarking different methods.

The ability of smart healthcare strategies to improve efficiency, patient's outcomes and delivery of quality healthcare has motivated and committed governments and policy makers to invest in this innovation. However, uptake and usage of smart healthcare strategies has not been successful as anticipated, and this is due to a number of challenges faced by different stakeholders during the adoption of these strategies. The objective of this paper is to systematically check published literature to identify and compile a comprehensive list of challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. Knowledge of these potential challenges gives stakeholders awareness and better prospects of dealing with the challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. A systematic literature review was conducted. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct were searched for full text, peer reviewed, English language articles that reported the challenges for successful adoption of smart healthcare management strategies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to select eligible articles. After the full screening, 26 articles that met the criteria were analysed and reported. Three main themes of challenges that affect the adoption of smart healthcare strategies have been identified based on technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework. The findings of this study demonstrate that different TOE challenges affect smart health strategies adoption by healthcare sector. This study, therefore, proposes a differentiated approach to policies and practices to effectively scale up adoption of smart health and reduce failure rates of smart health projects. It is concluded that future research is needed in identifying key change management strategies to successfully manage the identified challenges to improve the prospects of successful adoption of smart healthcare strategies.}

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is being successfully applied across multiple domains, yet these models learn in a most artificial way: they require large quantities of labeled data to grasp even simple concepts. Thus, the main bottleneck is often access to supervised data. Here, we highlight a trend in a potential solution to this challenge: synthetic data. Synthetic data are becoming accessible due to progress in rendering pipelines, generative adversarial models, and fusion models. Moreover, advancements in domain adaptation techniques help close the statistical gap between synthetic and real data. Paradoxically, this artificial solution is also likely to enable more natural learning, as seen in biological systems, including continual, multimodal, and embodied learning. Complementary to this, simulators and deep neural networks (DNNs) will also have a critical role in providing insight into the cognitive and neural functioning of biological systems. We also review the strengths of, and opportunities and novel challenges associated with, synthetic data.}

This research provides a comprehensive overview of data-driven approaches and processes for predicting personal thermal comfort in a building environment, as derived from a systematic review of 25 studies published in the last 10 years. After refining the concept of personal thermal comfort inspired by predictive modeling in personalized medicine and healthcare, the selection criteria were identified for the reviewed research. Then, three key elements affecting the data-driven modeling process were focused and reviewed, including experimental design, data collection, and modeling techniques. A special emphasis was placed on modeling techniques across the selected studies through a categorization process and comparison of their prediction accuracies. Feature selection and issues important for particular personal thermal comfort models were also reviewed and summarized. Upon reviewing these studies, the authors also considered inter- and intra-individual variability issues in sampling and modeling, data quantity and quality resulting from the collection procedure, model performance, feature importance, and implications for potential online learning techniques. Throughout these analyses, limitations of the current state-of-the-art and possible avenues for future study were addressed.}

Nevertheless, the utilization of lithium-ion batteries face a core difficulty associated with environmental degradation factors, capacity fade, aging-induced degradation, and end-of-life repurposing. These factors play a pivotal role in the field of EVs. In this regard, state-of-health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation outlines the efficacy of the batteries as well as facilitate in the development and testing of numerous EV optimizations with identification of parameters that will enhance and further improve their efficiency. Both indices give an accurate estimation of the battery performance, maintenance, prognostics, and health management. Accordingly, machine learning (ML) techniques provide a significant developmental scope as best parameters and approaches cannot be identified for these estimations. ML strategies comparatively provide a non-invasive approach with low computation and high accuracy considering the scalability and timescale issues of battery degradation. This paper objectively provides an inclusively extensive review on these topics based on the research conducted over the past decade. An in-depth introductory is provided for SOH and RUL estimation highlighting their process and significance. Furthermore, numerous ML techniques are thoroughly and independently investigated based on each category and sub-category implemented for SOH and RUL measurement.

abstract = {Machine learning has seen slow but steady uptake in diagnostic pathology over the past decade to assess digital whole-slide images. Machine learning tools have incredible potential to standardise, and likely even improve, histopathologic diagnoses, but they are not yet widely used in clinical practice. We describe the principles of these tools and technologies and some successful preclinical and pretranslational efforts in cardiovascular pathology, as well as a roadmap for moving forward. In nonhuman animal models, one proof-of-principle application is in rodent progressive cardiomyopathy, which is of particular significance to drug toxicity studies. Basic science successes include screening the quality of differentiated stem cells and characterising cardiomyocyte developmental stages, with potential applications for research and toxicology/drug safety screening using derived or native human pluripotent stem cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Translational studies of particular note include those with success in diagnosing the various forms of heart allograft rejection. For fully realising the value of these tools in clinical cardiovascular pathology, we identify 3 essential challenges. First is image quality standardisation to ensure that algorithms can be developed and implemented on robust, consistent data. The second is consensus diagnosis; experts don’t always agree, and thus “truth” may be difficult to establish, but the algorithms themselves may provide a solution. The third is the need for large-enough data sets to facilitate robust algorithm development, necessitating large cross-institutional shared image databases. The power of histopathology-based machine learning technologies is tremendous, and we outline the next steps needed to capitalise on this power.
Résumé
Au cours de la dernière décennie, l’apprentissage automatique a connu une adoption lente, mais constante, dans l’analyse des images numérisées de lamelle entière pour le diagnostic de maladies. Les outils d’apprentissage automatique ont un fabuleux potentiel de standardisation, voire d’amélioration, des diagnostics histopathologiques; ils ne sont toutefois pas encore largement utilisés en pratique clinique. Cet article vise à expliquer les principes de ces outils et technologies et à présenter certaines expériences précliniques et prétranslationnelles fructueuses en pathologie cardiovasculaire, de même qu’une feuille de route pour aller de l’avant. Dans les modèles animaux non humains, la cardiomyopathie évolutive chez le rongeur constitue une démonstration de principe qui revêt une importance particulière pour le succès des études toxicologiques. Les réussites en sciences fondamentales comprennent la sélection de cellules souches différenciées de qualité et la caractérisation des étapes du développement des cardiomyocytes, de même que leurs applications potentielles en recherche et en analyse toxicologique/de l’innocuité des médicaments à l’aide de cellules souches pluripotentes humaines ou dérivées se différenciant en cardiomyocytes. Les études translationnelles notables comprennent celles ayant permis de diagnostiquer les diverses formes de rejet d’allogreffe cardiaque. Pour pleinement comprendre la valeur de ces outils en pathologie clinique cardiovasculaire, nous avons repéré trois défis essentiels. Le premier est la standardisation de la qualité des images pour garantir que les algorithmes soient élaborés et mis en œuvre à partir de données solides et cohérentes. Le second est le diagnostic consensuel; les experts ne sont pas toujours d’accord, et par conséquent, il peut être difficile d’établir la « vérité », mais les algorithmes pourraient eux-mêmes fournir une solution. Le troisième est la nécessité de constituer des ensembles de données suffisantes pour favoriser l’élaboration d’algorithmes solides, ce qui nécessite de vastes bases de données d’images partagées entre les établissements. La puissance des technologies d’apprentissage automatique fondées sur l’histopathologie est immense; nous décrirons les prochaines étapes qui nous permettront de tirer profit de leur puissance.}

It enables the development of smart hardware as well as software platforms that operate on the basis of communication systems and the algorithms that process the data collected by the sensors to support decision-making. Although IoMT is involved in large-scale services provisioning in the medical paradigm; however, the resource-constrained nature of these devices makes them vulnerable to immense security and privacy issues. These vulnerabilities are not only disastrous for IoMT but threaten the whole healthcare ecosystem, which can in turn bring human lives in danger. During the past few years, threat vectors against IoMT have been evolved in terms of scalability, complexity, and diversity, which makes it challenging to detect and provide stringent defense solutions against these attacks. In this paper, we classify security and privacy challenges against different IoMT variants based on their actual usage in the healthcare domain. We provide a comprehensive attack taxonomy on the overall IoMT infrastructure comprising different device variants as well as elaborate taxonomies of security protocols to mitigate attacks against different devices, algorithms and describe their strengths and weaknesses. We also outline the security and privacy requirements for the development of novel security solutions for all the attack types against IoMT. Finally, we provide a comprehensive list of current challenges and future research directions that must be considered while developing sustainable security solutions for the IoMT infrastructure.}

abstract = {The immunization schedule recommended by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides a structure for how 10 different vaccine series should be administered to children in the first 18 months of life. Progress toward US early childhood immunization goals has largely focused on measuring vaccination coverage at age 24 months. However, standard vaccination coverage measures do not reflect whether children received vaccine doses by recommended ages, or whether vaccines were given concomitantly, per the schedule. In this paper, we describe innovations in population-level measurement of immunization schedule adherence through quantifying vaccination timeliness and undervaccination patterns. Measuring vaccination timeliness involves comparing when children received vaccine doses relative to ACIP age recommendations. To assess undervaccination patterns, children's vaccination histories are analyzed to determine whether they were vaccinated consistent with the ACIP schedule. Some patterns, such as spreading out vaccines across visits, are indicative of parental hesitancy. Other patterns, such as starting all recommended series but missing doses, are largely indicative of other immunization services delivery challenges. Since 2003, at least 12 studies have used National Immunization Survey-Child, immunization information system, or integrated health plan data to measure vaccination timeliness or undervaccination patterns at national or state levels. Moving forward, these novel measures can be leveraged for population-based surveillance of vaccine confidence, and for distinguishing undervaccination due to parental vaccine hesitancy from undervaccination due to other causes. Broader adoption of these measures can facilitate identification of targeted strategies for improving timely and routine early childhood vaccination uptake across the United States.}

abstract = {Background
In response to growing needs for the integration of heterogeneous data on food and nutrition security (FNS), and the current fragmentation of interoperability resources, the ‘FNS-Cloud project’ aims to develop a cross-domain, interoperable data platform that integrates diverse FNS data. Currently, there is insufficient guidance on how to develop such an FNS data platform and integrate a variety of FNS data types that differ in both their syntax and semantics.
Scope and approach
In the present study, we propose a generalizable workflow to guide data managers in building interoperable, cross-domain FNS data platforms, which centres around the definition of interoperability criteria that capture standardized data structures, terminologies and reporting formats for key variables across FNS data types. Information technology tools for automating different workflow steps are discussed. Finally, we include an illustrative case study, where we harmonize and link branded food datasets based on pre-defined interoperability criteria to answer an example research question.
Key findings and conclusions
Our work highlights the unique harmonization requirements within the FNS field. We provide two examples of how generic and domain-specific interoperability criteria addressing these requirements can be defined. Incoming FNS data must comply with defined criteria in order to enable their (semi-)automated integration into any data platform. Our case study reinforces the importance of semantic annotation of FNS data, and the need for clear mapping rules to be included into platform-internal semantic data models. The proposed workflow can be applied to any setting in which data managers strive towards harmonized and linked FNS data, and, thus, promotes an open-data and open-science environment.}

The deployment of various networks (e.g., Internet of Things [IoT] and mobile networks), databases (e.g., nutrition tables and food compositional databases), and social media (e.g., Instagram and Twitter) generates huge amounts of food data, which present researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to study various problems and applications in food science and industry via data-driven computational methods. However, these multi-source heterogeneous food data appear as information silos, leading to difficulty in fully exploiting these food data. The knowledge graph provides a unified and standardized conceptual terminology in a structured form, and thus can effectively organize these food data to benefit various applications. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to knowledge graphs and the evolution of food knowledge organization mainly from food ontology to food knowledge graphs. We then summarize seven representative applications of food knowledge graphs, such as new recipe development, diet-disease correlation discovery, and personalized dietary recommendation. We also discuss future directions in this field, such as multimodal food knowledge graph construction and food knowledge graphs for human health.}

It offers the prospect of mass customization, flexible production, on-demand and decentralized manufacturing. However, a number of challenges stem from not only the complexity of manufacturing systems but the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, in terms of design principles, standardization and quality control. These challenges build up barriers to the widespread adoption of AM in the industry and the in-depth research of AM in academia. To tackle the challenges, machine learning (ML) technologies rise to play a critical role as they are able to provide effective ways to quality control, process optimization, modelling of complex systems, and energy management. Hence, this paper employs a systematic literature review method as it is a defined and methodical way of identifying, assessing, and analysing published literature. Then, a keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis are employed for analysing relevant literature. Several aspects of AM, including Design for AM (DfAM), material analytics, in situ monitoring and defect detection, property prediction and sustainability, have been clustered and summarized to present state-of-the-art research in the scope of ML for AM.

This is due to the special characteristics of the data stream such as the concept drift, the limited time and space requirements, in addition to the impact of the well-known curse of dimensionality in high dimensional space. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have addressed these challenges simultaneously, and therefore detecting anomalies in this context requires a great deal of attention.

Efforts of improving the accuracy and/or certainty of deterministic or probabilistic wind power forecasts are continuously exerted by academics and industries. Forecast errors and associated uncertainties propagating through the whole forecasting chain, from weather provider to end user, cannot be eliminated completely. Therefore, understanding the uncertainty sources and how these uncertainties propagate throughout the modelling chain is significant to implement more rational and targeted uncertainty mitigation strategies and standardise the forecast and uncertainty validation. This paper presents a qualitative review on wind power forecasting uncertainty. First, the definition of uncertainty sources throughout the forecast modelling chain acts as a guiding line for checking and evaluating the uncertainty of a wind power forecast system/model. For each of the types of uncertainty sources, uncertainty mitigation strategies are provided, starting from the planning phase of wind farms, the establishment of a forecasting system through the operational phase and market phase. Our review finalises with a discussion on uncertainty validation with an example on ramp forecast validation. Highlights are a qualitative review and discussion including: (1) forecasting uncertainty exists and propagates everywhere throughout the entire modelling chain, from the planning phase to the market phase; (2) the mitigation efforts should be exerted in every modelling step; (3) standardised uncertainty validation practice, including why global data samples are required for forecasters to improve model performance and for forecast users to select and evaluate forecast model outputs.}

ML models could outperform PMV and adaptive models with up to 35.9% and 31% higher accuracy and PCMs could outperform PMV models with up to 74% higher accuracy.

The proportion of distributed energy sources within the electricity system increases steadily, which necessitates an improved monitoring capability to ensure the overall reliability and quality of the Electricity Supply Chain. Automation is strongly required to process the growing amount of data. Thus, it is inevitable to handle large amounts of heterogeneous data and process the information using forecasting and optimization techniques. Artificial Intelligence techniques are crucial for extending human cognitive abilities in these tasks. In our work, we synthesize the main impacts of the Artificial Intelligence paradigm on the automation of the Electricity Supply Chain. We describe the emerging automation through Artificial Intelligence in every layer of the Smart Grid Architecture Model and highlight state-of-the-art approaches. In the review, we focus on the following Electricity Supply Chain functionalities: generation, maintenance, pre-processing, analysis, forecasting, optimization, and trading within energy systems. After investigating the individual perspectives, we examine the potential implementation of a fully automated Electricity Supply Chain. Lastly, we discuss perspectives and limitations for the transformation from conventional to automated Electricity Supply Chains, specifically in terms of human interaction, Artificial Intelligence adaptation, energy transition, and sustainability.}

Computational models have great potential to revolutionise psychiatry research and clinical practice. These models are now used across multiple subfields, including computational psychiatry and precision psychiatry. Their goals vary from understanding mechanisms underlying disorders to deriving reliable classification and personalised predictions. Rapid growth of new tools and data sources (eg, digital data, gamification, and social media) requires an understanding of the constraints and advantages of different modelling approaches in psychiatry. In this Series paper, we take a critical look at the range of computational models that are used in psychiatry and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages for different purposes and data sources. We describe mechanism-driven and mechanism-agnostic computational models and discuss how interpretability of models is crucial for clinical translation. Based on these evaluations, we provide recommendations on how to build computational models that are clinically useful.}

These multisystem interactions are highly conserved from invertebrates to humans, however the complexity and diversity of human microbiota compositions often yield a context that is unique to each individual. Yet commonalities remain across species, where a healthy gut microbiome will be rich in symbiotic commensal biota while an unhealthy gut microbiota will be experiencing abnormal blooms of pathobiont bacteria. In this review we discuss how omics technologies can be applied in a personalized approach to understand the microbial crosstalk and microbial-host interactions that affect the delicate balance between eubiosis and dysbiosis in an individual gut microbiome. We further highlight the strengths of model organisms in identifying and characterizing these conserved synergistic and/or pathogenic host-microbe interactions.

Thus, this study reviews the literature on methodologies and data sources used in LCZs empirical research and identifies recurrent themes. A systematic review was conducted using bibliometric analysis and the PRISMA framework. Web of Science and Scopus databases were used to extract relevant datasets, and records were screened and extracted. Descriptive analyses reveal that most LCZ empirical research has been done on Chinese cities. Numerous data sources and analytical methods have been used, but Landsat and WUDAPT methodology is generally favored in the LCZ research due to its simplicity and freely available global datasets. Similarly, the review also shows that various software and methodologies are available to identify climate-sensitive areas of urban settlements with varying functionalities, accuracy, and visualizations. The thematic analysis indicates that the LCZ framework and its associated processes are being used in crosscutting phenomena such as thermal comfort, urban planning, climate change adaptation, and energy use. The review also suggests incorporating institutional and social aspects in local climate zones.

Many studies suggested various solutions for applying BESS to the grid system, yet the existing literature is dispersed across different scopes, scales, and levels. Previous studies also lack a comprehensive overview of different application strategies of BESS within the urban landscape. Therefore, this study aimed to broaden our perspective and implement the concept of “BESS-based energy sharing” for carbon-neutrality at the urban level. Towards this end, this study investigated the key factors and main technologies for BESS application in the city through a comprehensive literature review. These results indicated that the limitations of current application technologies of the BESS and energy sharing using BESS should be overcome in the carbon-neutral city. As a result, this study proposed future direction of the BESS application strategies towards smart energy sharing in cities, as follows: (i) bi-directional interactions across hierarchical levels of the city; (ii) integrated management for high connectivity of distributed generation; and (iii) development of a BESS-based energy management system. This study would allow scholars, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better understand the energy sharing mechanism within the city and provide systematic guidelines and pathways towards smart energy sharing with the advanced energy infrastructure using BESS from a bi-directional perspective across different hierarchical levels of the city.}

Unlike progressive tool wear, tool breakage occurs randomly, with more severe implications for workpiece quality, machining system stiffness, and even operator safety. Existing literature reviews on TCM focus on tool wear monitoring, including wear state recognition and remaining useful life prediction. However, a comprehensive review of tool breakage monitoring (TBM) techniques is lacking. Generic signal processing and intelligent decision-making methods cannot fully satisfy the practical requirements of the TBM. In addition, developing and evaluating TBM models using imbalanced data is more challenging. Herein, we present the first systematic review on TBM to bridge these limitations, and provide adequate guidance for avoiding catastrophic tool failures during cutting processes. Signal acquisition, feature extraction, and decision-making methodologies for the TBM are outlined and compared with related techniques for tool wear monitoring. The effects of data imbalance on TBM models are considered, and feasible solutions are provided at the data and algorithm levels. Finally, the challenges faced by the TBM are discussed, and potential research directions are suggested. The research and application of TBM techniques will certainly better empower various machining operations in response to intelligent manufacturing demands.}

Patient data is not only collected in clinical centers, like hospitals and private practices, but also by mobile healthcare apps or online websites. The abundance of collected patient data and the recent growth in the deep learning field has resulted in a large increase in research efforts. In Q2/2020, the search engine PubMed returned already over 11,000 results for the search term ‘deep learning’, and around 90% of these publications are from the last three years. However, even though PubMed represents the largest search engine in the medical field, it does not cover all medical-related publications.

abstract = {Background
The EU promotes ‘Open Science’ as a public good. Complementary to its implementation is Citizen Science, which redefines the relationship between the scientific community, civic society and the individual. Open Science and Citizen Science poses challenges for the substance use and addictions research community but may provide positive opportunities for future European addiction research. This paper explores both current barriers and potential facilitators for the implementation of Open Science and Citizen Science in substance use and addictions research.
Methodology
A scoping review was used to examine barriers and facilitators identified in the substance use and addiction research literature for the adoption of Open Science and Citizen Science.
Results
‘Technical’ facilitators included the pre-registration of study protocols; publication of open-source datasets; open peer review and online tools. ‘Motivational’ facilitators included enhanced reputation; embracing co-creation; engaged citizenship and gamification. ‘Economic’ facilitators included the use of free tools and balanced remuneration of crowdworkers. ‘Political’ facilitators included better informed debates through the ‘triple helix’ approach and trust-generating transparency. ‘Legal’ facilitators included epidemiologically informed law enforcement; better policy surveillance and the validation of other datasets. ‘Ethical’ facilitators included the ‘democratisation of science’ and opportunities to explore new concepts of ethics in addiction research.
Conclusion
Open Science and Citizen Science in substance use and addictions research may provide a range of benefits in relation to the democratisation of science; transparency; efficiency and the reliability/validity of data. However, its implementation raises a range of research integrity and ethical issues that need be considered. These include issues related to participant recruitment; privacy; confidentiality; security; cost and industry involvement. Progressive journal policies to support Open Science practices; a shift in researcher norms; the use of free tools and the greater availability of methodological and ethical standards are likely to increase adoption in the field.}

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence, computer science, communication, sensing and actuation technologies have resulted in the development of several novel intelligent systems. At the same time, the emergence of nanogenerators has opened a new research avenue with the overarching goal of developing self-powered sensing systems. The concepts of self-powered sensing, based on nanogenerators and intelligent systems can be fused together to open a new area of interdisciplinary research. In this article, we aim to show how these two emerging technologies have been combined to develop self-powered intelligent sensing systems. We first focus on the main keywords in the area of nanogenerators. Keyword co-occurrence network graphs are generated based on the most used keywords in the area of nanogenerators to select key concepts that are directly connected to the concept of intelligent systems. Thus, a detailed review is provided on different intelligent self-powered sensing systems based on nanogenerators. We also discuss the challenges presented by combining intelligent systems and self-powered sensing. As most of intelligent devices rely on machine learning techniques, a comprehensive section is allocated to this topic to focus on its applications in nanogenerator-based devices.}

abstract = {The development of renewable clean energy wind power is very rapid. However, the strong randomness and weak dispatchability of wind power bring significant challenges to wind power operation and maintenance, such as grid connection, power dispatch, and unit combination. At this stage, the combined model based on signal decomposition-prediction technology plays an essential role in ultra-short-term deterministic wind power prediction, promoting the development of the wind power industry. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, this paper discusses and summarizes the latest research progress on the critical technologies of the combined signal decomposition-prediction technology model to improve the prediction accuracy for the problem of high demand for ultra-short-term power prediction accuracy. Data decomposition from two perspectives of decomposition techniques reduces input data complexity and feature extraction by eliminating redundant information. The prediction techniques are from two perspectives: prediction methods to demonstrate specific laws and parameter search to determine the optimal parameters. Three perspectives evaluated prediction performance: vertical error evaluation, horizontal error evaluation, and prediction error evaluation by analyzing the above standard methods in detail, including the principle, idea, application examples, advantages and disadvantages, key points, and application notes of each technique. And the prediction performance of the current combined models is compared extensively. Finally, the future research trends of wind power ultra-short term are discussed and foreseen to provide a reference for the development of ultra-short-term power prediction technology, prediction performance improvement, and safe and stable grid operation.}

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can supply genetic data and determine the number of mutant genes in different cancers by sequencing the whole genome, exome, and/or transcriptome. For a specific organism, ribonucleic acid (RNA) content is represented by the transcriptome containing information about different diseases, functional genome elements, and molecular components of tissues and cells. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing, known as RNA-Seq, is a technology that uses NGS to show a snapshot of RNA at a given time from millions of individual RNAs. There are some biases in RNA-Seq, which can be classified as nucleotide composition, guanine-cytosine (GC) content, insert size, cell type, and contaminations. In molecular biology, contaminations can lead to biases in the genetic analysis results and difficulties in observing viral infections. Here we reviewed RNA-Seq methodologies, different contaminations that may occur during RNA-Seq preparation, and some methods that can be applied to estimate the transcript abundances of contaminated samples.}

High-throughput plant phenotyping is challenging owing to the spatio-temporal dynamics of traits. Proximal and remote sensing (PRS) techniques are increasingly used for plant phenotyping because of their advantages in multi-dimensional data acquisition and analysis. Substantial progress of PRS applications in PP has been observed over the last two decades and is analyzed here from an interdisciplinary perspective based on 2972 publications. This progress covers most aspects of PRS application in PP, including patterns of global spatial distribution and temporal dynamics, specific PRS technologies, phenotypic research fields, working environments, species, and traits. Subsequently, we demonstrate how to link PRS to multi-omics studies, including how to achieve multi-dimensional PRS data acquisition and processing, how to systematically integrate all kinds of phenotypic information and derive phenotypic knowledge with biological significance, and how to link PP to multi-omics association analysis. Finally, we identify three future perspectives for PRS-based PP: (1) strengthening the spatial and temporal consistency of PRS data, (2) exploring novel phenotypic traits, and (3) facilitating multi-omics communication.}

We use the image of the aluminum plate's surface states considering the tool's footprints, the cutting parameters, and the roughness average (Ra) obtained with a roughness meter to drive our model. We built a late multimodal fusion model with two networks, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory layers (LSTM). The first network consists of the first branch with a convolutional network that receives the input images. In the second network, modeling is performed by the LSTM network to receive the digital input data. This provides a framework to integrate information from two modalities to ensure surface quality in machining processes. This approach aims to assist in selecting the appropriate cutting tool and cutting parameters to automatically reproduce a machined piece using the image and roughness of an already existing piece. It is observed that the performance of the multimodal model is better than that of the unimodal model on image data. The accuracy continues to improve on both sets (training and validation), and the multimodal model finally reaches good accuracy results. Contrary to the unimodal model, which fails to generalize the training on a validation dataset. The results estimated by the multimodal fusion model are encouraging when applied to the milling activity in industrial production processes.}

Efficient recovery of these spent batteries is a significant way to achieve closed-loop lifecycle management and a green circular economy. It is crucial for carbon neutralization, and for coping with the environmental and resource challenges associated with the energy transition. EV-LIB disassembly is recognized as a critical bottleneck for mass-scale recycling. Automated disassembly of EV-LIBs is extremely challenging due to the large variety and uncertainty of retired EV-LIBs. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) provide new ways for addressing these problems. This study aims to provide a systematic review and forward-looking perspective on how AI/ML methodology can significantly boost EV-LIB intelligent disassembly for achieving sustainable recovery. This work examines the key advances and research opportunities of emerging intelligent technologies for EV-LIB disassembly, and recycling and reuse of industrial products in general. We show that AI could benefit the whole disassembly process, particularly addressing the uncertainty and safety issues. Currently, EV-LIB state prognostics, disassembly decision-making as well as target detection are indicated as promising areas to realize intelligence. The challenges still exist for extensive autonomy due to present AI's inherent limitations, mechanical and chemical complexities, and sustainable benefits concerns. This paper provides the practical map to direct how to implement EV-LIB intelligent disassembly as well as forward-looking perspectives for addressing these challenges.}

However, a systematic review of speed prediction in and between different levels is still missing. In this article, existing research is comprehensively analyzed and divided into three levels, i.e. macro traffic, micro vehicles, and meso lane. In addition, this article summarizes the influencing factors and reviews the prediction methods based on how those methods utilize the available information to meet the challenges of the prediction at different levels. This is followed by a summary of evaluation metrics, public datasets, and open-source codes. Finally, future directions in this field are discussed to inspire and guide readers. This article aims to draw a complete picture of speed prediction and promote the development of ITS.}

Especially reinforcement corrosion in concrete structures is a complex issue. As degradation starts internally, visual inspection lacks efficiency in early stages of the corrosion process. Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring provides major advantages as this technique enables to detect internal damage in an early stage. However, the use of AE monitoring also comes with certain challenges. The aim of this paper is to review appropriate protocols for AE-based reinforced concrete (RC) corrosion monitoring based on an overview of reported lab experiments, highlighting challenges and pitfalls, and to provide a solid basis for extension of the research focus towards on-site AE-based corrosion monitoring in RC structures. Therefore, this paper firstly discusses AE monitoring during (accelerated) corrosion tests, including methods for data analysis and best-practice protocols. Secondly, application of the AE technique for condition assessment of corroded RC elements during load testing is discussed. Thirdly, an overview is presented of reported on-site AE monitoring studies on corroding RC structures. The paper concludes with a discussion and future research challenges, especially towards on-site monitoring of existing RC structures.}

Increasing amounts of glycomics data are being generated thanks to advances in glycoanalytics technologies, but to maximize the value of such data, innovations are needed for analyzing and interpreting large-scale glycomics data. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a powerful analysis toolbox in many scientific fields, and here we review state-of-the-art AI approaches on glycosylation analysis.

Yet, technoscience is offering new tools that have the potential to reimagine how inland fisheries are assessed and managed. So-called “technoscience” refers to instances in which science and technology unfurl together, offering novel ways of spurring and achieving meaningful change. This paper considers the role of technoscience and its potential for modernizing the assessment and management of inland fisheries. It first explores technoscience and its potential benefits, followed by presentation of a series of synopses that explore the application (both successes and challenges) of new technologies such as environmental DNA (eDNA), genomics, electronic tags, drones, phone apps, iEcology, and artificial intelligence to assessment and management. The paper also considers the challenges and barriers that exist in adopting new technologies. The paper concludes with a provocative assessment of the potential of technoscience to reform and modernize inland fisheries assessment and management. Although these tools are increasingly being embraced, there is a lack of platforms for aggregating these data streams and providing managers with actionable information in a timely manner. The ideas presented here should serve as a catalyst for beginning to work collectively and collaboratively towards fisheries assessment and management systems that harness the power of technology and serve to modernize inland fisheries management. Such transformation is urgently needed given the dynamic nature of environmental change, the evolving threat matrix facing inland waters, and the complex behavior of fishers. Quite simply, a dynamic world demands dynamic fisheries management; technoscience has made that within reach.}

Effective defect management, which is essential for maintaining the performance and longevity of buildings, requires regular defect inspections. Such inspections are expensive and time-consuming, traditionally taking the form of unstructured textual data. Classifying the collected data is complex, potentially leading to errors. A systematic classification system that considers a wide range of characteristics, including work type, defect location, defect element and defect type, is urgently needed. We propose a new automated defect text classification system (AutoDefect) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and natural language processing (NLP) using hierarchical two-stage encoders. A variant channel attention mechanism (the text squeeze-and-excitation block) is incorporated for one-dimensional CNN-based text modeling that extracts robust features for each encoder to improve classification performance. Testing the model on Korean textual defect data, AutoDefect outperformed three recent NLP models, BERT, ELECTRA and GPT-2, and was significantly more cost-effective, dramatically reducing the time required for defect management and minimizing human error.}

abstract = {We present a literature review of Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition (AIPR) for the inspection of photovoltaic (PV) modules under the main used spectra: (1) true-color RGB, (2) long-wave infrared (LWIR), and (3) electroluminescence-based short-wave infrared (SWIR). Three sequentially linked building blocks underpin this work. The first overviews reference guidelines of image acquisition and the main detectable defect patterns under each spectrum. It also provides key insights regarding the implementation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to acquire imagery, especially from a photogrammetric perspective. The second block presents various image pre-processing steps used to prepare inspection-ready datasets. These comprise radiometric correction, segmentation and edge extraction, geometric correction and cell clipping. The third surveys defect detection and classification through digital image processing and machine/deep learning techniques. We elaborate an in-depth topic discussion that, in parallel: highlights the main related challenges, provides core guidelines for AIPR-based PV inspection workflows, and suggests key research avenues for future studies. This review synthesizes the recent advances of the body knowledge. It also constitutes an insightful reference for professionals and academics within the PV operations and maintenance field who are considering the possibilities that digital imagery can offer.}

abstract = {Summary
As neuroscience projects increase in scale and cross international borders, different ethical principles, national and international laws, regulations, and policies for data sharing must be considered. These concerns are part of what is collectively called data governance. Whereas neuroscience data transcend borders, data governance is typically constrained within geopolitical boundaries. An international data governance framework and accompanying infrastructure can assist investigators, institutions, data repositories, and funders with navigating disparate policies. Here, we propose principles and operational considerations for how data governance in neuroscience can be navigated at an international scale and highlight gaps, challenges, and opportunities in a global brain data ecosystem. We consider how to approach data governance in a way that balances data protection requirements and the need for open science, so as to promote international collaboration through federated constructs such as the International Brain Initiative (IBI).}
