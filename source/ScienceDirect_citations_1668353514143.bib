abstract = {To fully understand how a construction project actually proceeds, a novel framework for automated process discovery from building information modeling (BIM) event logs is developed. The significance of the work is to manage and optimize the complex construction process towards the ultimate goal of narrowing the gap between BIM and process mining. More specifically, meaningful information is retrieved from prepared event logs to build a participant-specific process model, and then the established model with executable semantics and fitness guarantees provides evidence in process improvement through identifying deviations, inefficiencies, and collaboration features. The proposed method has been validated in a case study, where the input is an as-planned event log from a real BIM construction project. The process model is created automatically by the inductive mining and fuzzy mining algorithms, which is then analyzed deeply under the joint use of conformance checking, frequency and bottleneck analysis, and social network analysis (SNA). The discovered knowledge contributes to revealing potential problems and evaluating the performance of workflows and participants objectively. In the discussion part, as-built data from the internet of things (IoT) deployment in construction site monitoring is automatically compared with the as-planned event log in the BIM platform to detect the actual delays. It turns out that the participant playing a central role in the network tends to overburden with heavier workloads, leading to more undesirable discrepancies and delays. As a result, extensive investigations based on process mining supports data-driven decision making to strategically smooth the construction process and increase collaboration opportunities, which also help in reducing the risk of project failure ahead of time.}

abstract = {I engage the philosophy of geology, and the philosophy of planetary geomorphology in particular, offering a perspective from the standpoint of a Mars geographer who is acquainted with both experimental and social research. I discuss the nature of geological reasoning and probe its somewhat paradoxical commitment to both a physical realism and to interpretative narrative construction, engaging particularly with how the interplay of these two factors are addressed in the works of the philosopher-geologist Victor Baker. I also draw attention to specific characteristics of knowledge construction in Martian geomorphology which systemically limit the attachment of our inferences to a physical reality. For instance I highlight a geospatial-geochemical dimorphism in the semantic content of available planetary data and several non-scientific controls on the knowledge construction process, including mission safety constraints and sociopolitical factors. Lastly, I find that physical geography has grown apart from planetary geomorphology in the decades since planetary geomorphology assumed its largely geological modern form. An academic siloing effect has followed suit. An immediate implication is that this contours the typical pathways of knowledge construction in our discipline, and I try to call attention to a few examples of this effect. As an effort to bridge this gap, I highlight the recent developments of the physical geographical subdisciplines of GIScience and critical physical geography. These disciplines offer opportunities for insight which might be fruitful for planetary geomorphologists, but their lines of inquiry have largely passed beneath our community’s radar. Specifically, in offering examples of what discourse in a critical planetary geology might look like, I hope to encourage the informal philosophical discussions already circulating in our community to pass into a formal space of debate.}

To harness the full potential of smart city initiatives, it is vital for policymakers to align citizens with the project objectives. This study comprehensively characterizes and classifies top-down announcements formulated by city developers into six alignment categories (i.e., smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living) using natural language processing. The proposed framework consists of five main processes: (1) web scraping-based extraction of announcements of four smart cities – Boston, Helsinki, Seoul, and Taipei, (2) text data preprocessing, (3) latent Dirichlet allocation-based modeling of strategic topics, (4) quantification of inter-topic similarities using Hellinger distance, and (5) comparison of top-down communication trends with real-world levels of urban performance. Through the comparative analysis of top-down communication trends and actual urban performances, the top-down discourses of smart cities were deconstructed as a reflection of wider political programs developed to enhance citizen alignment and urban performances. Furthermore, inter-topic similarities were also quantified to reflect whether communication strategies are multidisciplinary and city-tailored. In conclusion, the findings of this study can enhance our understanding and provide workable guidance for future smart city development.}

To meet the demand of large-scale high-throughput phenotyping, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been developed for near-ground remote sensing. UAVs based remote sensing has been used for high-throughput phenotyping of various traits of plants. This review focused on the applications of UAVs based remote sensing of different traits with different phenotyping sensors. In this review, the UAVs platforms and the phenotyping sensors were briefly introduced. The applications of UAVs to obtain and analyze plant phenotype traits were introduced and summarized by the traits in a more comprehensive way. A comparison of different phenotyping sensors was conducted. Furthermore, the challenges and future prospects of phenotype information acquisition and data analysis using UAVs as remote sensing platforms were also discussed. Since the current studies from various countries and researchers were fragmented to just explore the feasibility of UAVs based high-throughput phenotyping, this review aimed to provide the researchers and readers the current applications of UAVs for high-throughput phenotyping and how the studies were conducted, provide guidelines for future studies.}

abstract = {Civil infrastructure (e.g., buildings, roads, underground tunnels) could lose its expected physical and functional conditions after years of operation. Timely and accurate inspection and assessment of such infrastructures are essential to ensure safety and serviceability, e.g., by preventing unsafe working conditions and hazards. Cracks, which are one of the most common distress, can indicate severe structural integrity issues that threaten the safety of the structure and people in the environment. As such, accurate, fast, and automatic detection of cracks on structure surfaces is a major issue for a variety of civil engineering applications. Due to advances in hardware data acquisition systems, significant progress has been made in the automatic detection and quantification of cracks in recent decades. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the research progress and prospects in computer vision frameworks for crack detection of civil infrastructures from multiple materials, including asphalt, concrete, and metal-like materials. The review encompasses major components of typical frameworks, i.e., data acquisition techniques, publicly available datasets, detection algorithms, and evaluation metrics. In particular, we provide a taxonomy of detection algorithms with a detailed discussion of the advantages, limitations, and application scenarios of the methods in each category, as well as the relationships between methods of different categories. We also discuss unsolved issues and key challenges in crack detection that could drive future research directions.}

abstract = {The element carbon plays a central role in climate and life on Earth. It is capable of moving among the geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere. This flow of carbon is referred to as the Earth's carbon cycle. It is also intimately linked to the cycling of other elements and compounds. The ocean plays a fundamental role in Earth's carbon cycle, helping to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentration. The ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP), defined as a set of processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, is at the heart of the ocean carbon cycle. Monitoring the OBCP is critical to understanding how the Earth's carbon cycle is changing. At present, satellite remote sensing is the only tool available for viewing the entire surface ocean at high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we review methods for monitoring the OBCP with a focus on satellites. We begin by providing an overview of the OBCP, defining and describing the pools of carbon in the ocean, and the processes controlling fluxes of carbon between the pools, from the surface to the deep ocean, and among ocean, land and atmosphere. We then examine how field measurements, from ship and autonomous platforms, complement satellite observations, provide validation points for satellite products and lead to a more complete view of the OBCP than would be possible from satellite observations alone. A thorough analysis is then provided on methods used for monitoring the OBCP from satellite platforms, covering current capabilities, concepts and gaps, and the requirement for uncertainties in satellite products. We finish by discussing the potential for producing a satellite-based carbon budget for the oceans, the advantages of integrating satellite-based observations with ecosystem models and field measurements, and future opportunities in space, all with a view towards bringing satellite observations into the limelight of ocean carbon research.}

Access to such resources at the right time affects the quality of healthcare services and provides alternative treatments that can save patients’ lives. Achieving this goal becomes more challenging when there are large number of patients who have chronic diseases. Machine learning algorithms provide a very promising solution that can help healthcare administrators make the right decision at the right time. Machine learning model can predict the progress of pandemics, classify a patient with well-defined symptoms as contagious or not, and can also predict the number of patients who will be hospitalized in the future. This chapter shows how to utilize machine learning algorithms to create a models that can predict some of the key issues in healthcare systems. The discussion in the chapter relates to COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the solutions offered by machine learning in such scenarios. The chapter also highlights the significance of feature engineering and its impact on the accuracy of machine learning models. The chapter ends with two case studies. The first case study shows how to build a prediction model that can predict the number of diabetic patients who will visit certain hospitals in a specific geographic location in future years. The second case study analyzes health records during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

Thus, the security of the SCADA is very important, not only to keep the continuity of services (i.e., availability) against hostile and cyber-terrorist attacks, but also to ensure the resilience and integrity of processes and actions. Dealing with this issue, this paper discusses SCADA vulnerabilities and security threats, with a focus on recent ones. Then, we define a holistic methodology to derive the suitable security mechanisms for this kind of critical systems. Our methodology starts by identifying the security needs and objectives, specifying the security policies and models, deriving the adapted architecture and, finally, implementing the security mechanisms that satisfy the needs and cover the risks. We focus on the modelling step by proposing the new CI-OrBAC model. In this paper, we focused on securing communication and protecting SCADA against both internal and external threats while satisfying the self-healing, intrusion tolerance, integrity, scalability and collaboration needs.}

abstract = {To tackle the alarming increase in e-waste or end-of-life (EoL) electronic products, consumer behavior towards the end of their useful life needs to be thoroughly studied. End users or consumers are the starting point where e-waste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy (CE), such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. E-waste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of e-waste with household waste by consumers. Studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to achieve CE. Numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers' e-waste-related knowledge and awareness, and behavior on consumption, disposal, storage, recycling, and repair. Substantial knowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around e-waste may be integrated into the CE model. This article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing 109 research papers published in international peer-reviewed journals identified in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database, using content analysis methodology to analyze and review the articles. The study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a more consumer-centric CE framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and implementation strategies around e-waste. This is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer behavior around e-waste. The study results show that consumers' disposal and recycling behaviors are the two main areas of research interest in the studies reviewed. In contrast, reuse and repair behavior were investigated to a lesser extent. In this study, several research gaps and areas for future research are identified, along with suggestions for a CE framework focusing on the e-waste sector that, encompasses policy initiatives and business model innovations. The identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are starting to work on consumer behavior-related e-waste research.}

Firstly, the new information variable weight buffer operator is proposed, and it follows the principle of “New information priority”. The new information is assigned larger weight under the action of the buffer operator. On the basis of the buffer operator, the new information variable weight fractional order accumulating generated operator is proposed, which has the dual functions of accumulation and weighting. In addition, the idea of metabolism is introduced to the model, which adds the latest online public opinion time point data and eliminates the earliest data. Finally, this model is applied to forecast the online public opinion trends with monotonically increasing sequence, monotonically decreasing sequence, and oscillation sequence. Compared with other models, the new information variable-weight fractional rolling grey model has better prediction performance in the online public opinion.}

abstract = {The increasing number of security attacks have inspired researchers to employ various classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs), to deal with them in Intrusion detection systems (IDSs). This paper presents a comprehensive study and investigation of the SVM-based intrusion detection and feature selection systems proposed in the literature. It first presents the essential concepts and background knowledge about security attacks, IDS, and SVM classifiers. It then provides a taxonomy of the SVM-based IDS schemes and describes how they have adapted numerous types of SVM classifiers in detecting various types of anomalies and intrusions. Moreover, it discusses the main contributions of the investigated schemes and highlights the algorithms and techniques combined with the SVM to enhance its detection rate and accuracy. Finally, different properties and limitations of the SVM-based IDS schemes are discussed.}

abstract = {Given the rapid growth of autonomous technologies it is important to understand how consumers attribute value to them. Such technologies require consumers to give up control to a machine by delegating decision-making power. To better understand value perceptions, and ultimately adoption, this paper proposes a conceptual model that explains the value attributed to autonomous cars as an archetypal consumer autonomous technology. The model is developed from literature around the theme of autonomy and two qualitative studies, which identify consumers’ perceived individual benefits (Freeing Time, Overcoming Human Weaknesses, Outperforming Human Capacities), risks (Loss of Competencies, Security and Privacy risk, Performance risk) and their proximal antecedents (Perceived Expertise, Attitude toward the Delegated Task, Previous Engagement in Delegation). The model is tested on a national sample of French drivers using a quantitative methodology and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). This research contributes to literature on technological forecasting of autonomous technologies by developing and testing a conceptual model, which includes salient predictors of perceived value and highlights the mediating role of improvement in subjective well-being that consumers anticipate from adoption. The model can be used by managers to predict how users are likely to react to their products and communications about them.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Measuring routine childhood vaccination is crucial to inform global vaccine policies and programme implementation, and to track progress towards targets set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and Immunization Agenda 2030. Robust estimates of routine vaccine coverage are needed to identify past successes and persistent vulnerabilities. Drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020, Release 1, we did a systematic analysis of global, regional, and national vaccine coverage trends using a statistical framework, by vaccine and over time.
Methods
For this analysis we collated 55 326 country-specific, cohort-specific, year-specific, vaccine-specific, and dose-specific observations of routine childhood vaccination coverage between 1980 and 2019. Using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, we produced location-specific and year-specific estimates of 11 routine childhood vaccine coverage indicators for 204 countries and territories from 1980 to 2019, adjusting for biases in country-reported data and reflecting reported stockouts and supply disruptions. We analysed global and regional trends in coverage and numbers of zero-dose children (defined as those who never received a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTP] vaccine dose), progress towards GVAP targets, and the relationship between vaccine coverage and sociodemographic development.
Findings
By 2019, global coverage of third-dose DTP (DTP3; 81·6% [95% uncertainty interval 80·4–82·7]) more than doubled from levels estimated in 1980 (39·9% [37·5–42·1]), as did global coverage of the first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1; from 38·5% [35·4–41·3] in 1980 to 83·6% [82·3–84·8] in 2019). Third-dose polio vaccine (Pol3) coverage also increased, from 42·6% (41·4–44·1) in 1980 to 79·8% (78·4–81·1) in 2019, and global coverage of newer vaccines increased rapidly between 2000 and 2019. The global number of zero-dose children fell by nearly 75% between 1980 and 2019, from 56·8 million (52·6–60·9) to 14·5 million (13·4–15·9). However, over the past decade, global vaccine coverage broadly plateaued; 94 countries and territories recorded decreasing DTP3 coverage since 2010. Only 11 countries and territories were estimated to have reached the national GVAP target of at least 90% coverage for all assessed vaccines in 2019.
Interpretation
After achieving large gains in childhood vaccine coverage worldwide, in much of the world this progress was stalled or reversed from 2010 to 2019. These findings underscore the importance of revisiting routine immunisation strategies and programmatic approaches, recentring service delivery around equity and underserved populations. Strengthening vaccine data and monitoring systems is crucial to these pursuits, now and through to 2030, to ensure that all children have access to, and can benefit from, lifesaving vaccines.

abstract = {Summary
Neurodegenerative diseases are challenging for systems biology because of the lack of reliable animal models or patient samples at early disease stages. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could address these challenges. We investigated DNA, RNA, epigenetics, and proteins in iPSC-derived motor neurons from patients with ALS carrying hexanucleotide expansions in C9ORF72. Using integrative computational methods combining all omics datasets, we identified novel and known dysregulated pathways. We used a C9ORF72 Drosophila model to distinguish pathways contributing to disease phenotypes from compensatory ones and confirmed alterations in some pathways in postmortem spinal cord tissue of patients with ALS. A different differentiation protocol was used to derive a separate set of C9ORF72 and control motor neurons. Many individual -omics differed by protocol, but some core dysregulated pathways were consistent. This strategy of analyzing patient-specific neurons provides disease-related outcomes with small numbers of heterogeneous lines and reduces variation from single-omics to elucidate network-based signatures.}

abstract = {Reservoir simulation models are used to forecast future reservoir behavior and to optimally manage reservoir production. These models require specification of hundreds of thousands of parameters, some of which may be determined from measurements along well paths, but the distance between wells can be large and the formations in which oil and gas are found are almost always heterogeneous with many geological complexities so many of the reservoir parameters are poorly constrained by well data. Additional constraints on the values of the parameters are provided by general geologic knowledge, and other constraints are provided by historical measurements of production and injection behavior. This type of information is often not sufficient to identify locations of either currently remaining oil, or to provide accurate forecasts where oil will remain at the end of project life. The repeated use of surface seismic surveys offers the promise of providing observations of locations of changes in physical properties between wells, thus reducing uncertainty in predictions of future reservoir behavior. Unfortunately, while methodologies for assimilation of 4D seismic data have demonstrated substantial value in synthetic model studies, the application to real fields has not been as successful. In this paper, we review the literature on 4D seismic history matching (SHM), focusing discussions on the aspects of the problem that make it more difficult than the more traditional production history matching. In particular, we discuss the possible choices for seismic attributes that can be used for comparison between observed or modeled attribute to determine the properties of the reservoir and the difficulty of estimating the magnitude of the noise or bias in the data. Depending on the level of matching, the bias may result from errors in the forward modeling, or errors in the inversion. Much of the practical literature has focused on methodologies for reducing the effect of bias or modeling error either through choice of attribute, or by appropriate weighting of data. Applications to field cases appear to have been at least partially successful, although quantitative assessment of the history matches and the improvements in forecast is difficult.}

We discuss six widely different examples of IMs, which are useful by themselves and furthermore illustrate the very broad scope of IMs.}

abstract = {A high estimate of not only workplace fatal injuries but also nonfatal injuries and illnesses via overexertion, and contact with objects, equipment, and machinery workplace has been reported over the years. To address this issue, the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) program has put an emphasis on policy and regulation for prevention, protection, and improvement of the individuals’ health related to the working conditions and industrial environment. In the last 10 years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has matured to seamlessly enable real-time communications and cooperation among machines, environments, and humans using data analytics. Thus, IoT offers potential technical solutions for the prevention and protection of workplace injuries and illnesses. Moreover, IoT invites opportunities for collaboration with OHS in various industries. This article presents a systematic mapping study of the literature to address the impact of IoT on occupational well-being, analyzing the progress of Industry 4.0 during the last decade. This study systematizes the literature providing a taxonomy of the area through the results of four general, four focused, and two statistical research questions. These questions outline industrial environments and aspects of health concerning workers’ well-being, concentrating on a human-centered approach leveraged by physiological measurements and psychological health. In addition, this paper explores questions regarding IoT’s technical components, such as sensors, devices, and communication technologies, investigating methods of data processing supported by the employment of classification algorithms and data fusion strategies. As a result, the systematic mapping process initially found 7515 articles from six academic databases in the period from 2009 to 2019. After the execution of filtering methods, a complete read of 67 articles allowed to answer quantitatively and qualitatively the research questions. The classification of the answers contributed to systematize the literature through the taxonomy and the relationships among the topics covered by the articles. Accordingly, this research produced theoretical benefits, mainly, a broad view of the state-of-the-art, a taxonomy to guide related researches, and guidelines for future works. Furthermore, this research would benefit management and corporations by shedding light on technologies explored in the literature and elucidating their feasibility in support of the workforce’s safety, psychological, and physical health.}

abstract = {Nanotechnology and more particularly nanotechnology-based products and materials have provided a huge potential for novel solutions to many of the current challenges society is facing. However, nanotechnology is also an area of product innovation that is sometimes developing faster than regulatory frameworks. This is due to the high complexity of some nanomaterials, the lack of a globally harmonised regulatory definition and the different scopes of regulation at a global level. Research organisations and regulatory bodies have spent many efforts in the last two decades to cope with these challenges. Although there has been a significant advancement related to analytical approaches for labelling purposes as well as to the development of suitable test guidelines for nanomaterials and their safety assessment, there is a still a need for greater global collaboration and consensus in the regulatory field. Furthermore, with growing societal concerns on plastic litter and tiny debris produced by degradation of littered plastic objects, the impact of micro- and nanoplastics on humans and the environment is an emerging issue. Despite increasing research and initial regulatory discussions on micro- and nanoplastics, there are still knowledge gaps and thus an urgent need for action. As nanoplastics can be classified as a specific type of incidental nanomaterials, current and future scientific investigations should take into account the existing profound knowledge on nanotechnology/nanomaterials when discussing issues around nanoplastics. This review was conceived at the 2019 Global Summit on Regulatory Sciences that took place in Stresa, Italy, on 24–26 September 2019 (GSRS 2019) and which was co-organised by the Global Coalition for Regulatory Science Research (GCRSR) and the European Commission's (EC) Joint Research Centre (JRC). The GCRSR consists of regulatory bodies from various countries around the globe including EU bodies. The 2019 Global Summit provided an excellent platform to exchange the latest information on activities carried out by regulatory bodies with a focus on the application of nanotechnology in the agriculture/food sector, on nanoplastics and on nanomedicines, including taking stock and promoting further collaboration. Recently, the topic of micro- and nanoplastics has become a new focus of the GCRSR. Besides discussing the challenges and needs, some future directions on how new tools and methodologies can improve the regulatory science were elaborated by summarising a significant portion of discussions during the summit. It has been revealed that there are still some uncertainties and knowledge gaps with regard to physicochemical properties, environmental behaviour and toxicological effects, especially as testing described in the dossiers is often done early in the product development process, and the material in the final product may behave differently. The harmonisation of methodologies for quantification and risk assessment of nanomaterials and micro/nanoplastics, the documentation of regulatory science studies and the need for sharing databases were highlighted as important aspects to look at.}

abstract = {Currently, the most common disease is the new coronavirus disease identified as COVID-19. Various techniques to identifying the COVID-19 disease have been offered. Computer vision techniques are widely used to classify COVID-19 with the use of chest X-ray images. Rapid clinical results may prevent COVID-19 from spreading and help doctors treat patients under high workload conditions. As the normal diagnosis phase of illness with a laboratory test is time-consuming and requires a well-equipped laboratory, the X-ray imaging technique is a fast and cheap diagnostic tool for COVID-19. Machine learning methods can enhance the diagnosis of COVID-19 as a decision support platform for radiologists. This chapter utilizes various convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including pretrained models, to classify X-ray images into three classes: COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. CNN, a form of deep neural networks that have become dominant in various computer vision tasks, attracts interest across various domains, including radiology. Pretrained models on ImageNet are good at detecting high-level features such as edges and patterns. These models understand certain representations of features, which can be reused. Also, deep classifiers have shown promising results in many kinds of work across various domains. We drew some useful results from these classifiers, which could be used faster when detecting COVID-19. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of the VGG19 classifier is 97.56%.}

abstract = {Segmentation of abdominal organs has been a comprehensive, yet unresolved, research field for many years. In the last decade, intensive developments in deep learning (DL) introduced new state-of-the-art segmentation systems. Despite outperforming the overall accuracy of existing systems, the effects of DL model properties and parameters on the performance are hard to interpret. This makes comparative analysis a necessary tool towards interpretable studies and systems. Moreover, the performance of DL for emerging learning approaches such as cross-modality and multi-modal semantic segmentation tasks has been rarely discussed. In order to expand the knowledge on these topics, the CHAOS – Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation challenge was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2019, in Venice, Italy. Abdominal organ segmentation from routine acquisitions plays an important role in several clinical applications, such as pre-surgical planning or morphological and volumetric follow-ups for various diseases. These applications require a certain level of performance on a diverse set of metrics such as maximum symmetric surface distance (MSSD) to determine surgical error-margin or overlap errors for tracking size and shape differences. Previous abdomen related challenges are mainly focused on tumor/lesion detection and/or classification with a single modality. Conversely, CHAOS provides both abdominal CT and MR data from healthy subjects for single and multiple abdominal organ segmentation. Five different but complementary tasks were designed to analyze the capabilities of participating approaches from multiple perspectives. The results were investigated thoroughly, compared with manual annotations and interactive methods. The analysis shows that the performance of DL models for single modality (CT / MR) can show reliable volumetric analysis performance (DICE: 0.98 ± 0.00 / 0.95 ± 0.01), but the best MSSD performance remains limited (21.89 ± 13.94 / 20.85 ± 10.63 mm). The performances of participating models decrease dramatically for cross-modality tasks both for the liver (DICE: 0.88 ± 0.15 MSSD: 36.33 ± 21.97 mm). Despite contrary examples on different applications, multi-tasking DL models designed to segment all organs are observed to perform worse compared to organ-specific ones (performance drop around 5%). Nevertheless, some of the successful models show better performance with their multi-organ versions. We conclude that the exploration of those pros and cons in both single vs multi-organ and cross-modality segmentations is poised to have an impact on further research for developing effective algorithms that would support real-world clinical applications. Finally, having more than 1500 participants and receiving more than 550 submissions, another important contribution of this study is the analysis on shortcomings of challenge organizations such as the effects of multiple submissions and peeking phenomenon.}

abstract = {This research proposes a game theory model in a supply chain (SC) involving one manufacturer and one retailer. The SC works in a global market in which consumers are located worldwide and subject to traceability issues that can create distrust of the product quality. This issue can be resolved by implementing blockchain technology which provides benefits in terms of high traceability along with low transaction costs. However, blockchain negatively impacts the environment because of their high energy consumption. Therefore, in this study, we capture the trade-offs between traceability and sustainability for blockchain adoption by characterizing a game theory model. Our findings show that high levels of distrust pushes firms to avoid the implementation of blockchain. In such circumstances, blockchain is not sufficient to make consumers recognize the product quality and trust the firms’ practices. In contrast, low levels of distrust can make blockchain an economically suitable technology conditioned to minimal environmental damages; otherwise, firms need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between distrust and sustainability. Since the adoption of blockchain leads to an increase in prices and decrease of distrust, two factors determine whether to pursue this technology or not: low consumer sensitivity to price and high sensitivity to quality. In this study, we develop three specific cases where we model: 1) the direct impact of blockchain on distrust, 2) a stochastic distrust term, and 3) a Stackelberg game. Each case confirms our results and strengthens the robustness of our findings.}

For instance, weather forecasting provides decision making support for autonomous vehicles to reduce traffic accidents and congestions, which completely depend on the sensing and predicting of external environmental factors such as rainfall, air visibility and so on. Accurate and timely weather prediction has always been the goal of meteorological scientists. However, the conventional theory-driven numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods face many challenges, such as incomplete understanding of physical mechanisms, difficulties in obtaining useful knowledge from the deluge of observation data, and the requirement of powerful computing resources. With the successful application of data-driven deep learning method in various fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and time series prediction, it has been proven that deep learning method can effectively mine the temporal and spatial features from the spatio-temporal data. Meteorological data is a typical big geospatial data. Deep learning-based weather prediction (DLWP) is expected to be a strong supplement to the conventional method. At present, many researchers have tried to introduce data-driven deep learning into weather forecasting, and have achieved some preliminary results. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art studies of deep learning-based weather forecasting, in the aspects of the design of neural network (NN) architectures, spatial and temporal scales, as well as the datasets and benchmarks. Then we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of DLWP by comparing it with the conventional NWP, and summarize the potential future research topics of DLWP.}

In this connection, effective land administration is a significant element to actualize sustainable development. Yet existing building permit procedures fail to satisfy the need for current construction demands because of the insufficient transparency and inefficient procedures. Two dimensional (2D) based systems also remain incapable to unambiguously delineate the property ownership related to complex buildings. Keeping up-to-date the three dimensional (3D) urban models is another key for smart cities but this issue has become difficult owing to the rapid changes in the cities. In this sense, this paper first examines thoroughly the current situation in Turkey in terms of the building permit procedures, land administration, and 3D city modeling. Then, the paper detailedly proposes a reformative framework. The framework consists of the use of digital building models for both building permit processes and 3D registration of property ownership, as well as updating the 3D city model databases. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of its applicability with a discussion of the prospective directions.}

Hardware parallelism is critical for the performance of single-core processors, multicore processors, systems on a chip, multiprocessor systems, clusters, and warehouse-scale computers, which are the backbone of computer clouds. The first sections cover parallel and distributed system hardware, stressing the quantitative rather than qualitative aspects of computer architecture. Basic architectural concepts of modern computer systems, optimization of computer architecture including caching, out-of-order instruction execution, dynamic scheduling, branch predictions, and ARM architecture are discussed in Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively. Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 cover SIMD architectures, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and SoCs (Systems On a Chip) and edge cloud computing. Section 3.8 covers data, task, and thread-level parallelism. Extracting parallelism depends on the application; Sections 3.9 and 3.10 analyze the speedup limits given by Amdahl's law, Amdahl's law for multicore processors, and scaled speedup. Section 3.11 reviews the evolution of most powerful computing systems, from supercomputers to large-scale distributed systems. Organization principles for distributed systems, such as modularity and layering, presented in Sections 3.12 and 3.13, are applied to the design of the peer-to-peer and large-scale systems discussed in Sections 3.14 and 3.15, respectively.

A substandard ship can be detained in an inspection if serious deficiencies are found onboard. Ship detention is regarded as a severe result in port state control inspection. However, developing accurate prediction models for ship detention based on ship’s generic factors (e.g. ship age, type, and flag), dynamic factors (e.g. times of ship flag changes), and inspection historical factors (e.g. total previous detentions in PSC inspection, last PSC inspection time, and last deficiency number in PSC inspection) before an inspection is conducted is not a trivial task as the low detention rate leads to a highly imbalanced inspection records dataset. To address this issue, this paper develops a classification model called balanced random forest (BRF) to predict ship detention by using 1,600 inspection records at the Hong Kong port for three years. Numerical experiments show that the proposed BRF model can identify 81.25% of all the ships with detention in the test set which contains another 400 inspection records. Compared with the current ship selection method at the Hong Kong port, the BRF model is much more efficient and can achieve an average improvement of 73.72% in detained ship identification.}

abstract = {The research initiative “self-improving system integration” (SISSY) was established with the goal to master the ever-changing demands of system organisation in the presence of autonomous subsystems, evolving architectures, and highly-dynamic open environments. It aims to move integration-related decisions from design-time to run-time, implying a further shift of expertise and responsibility from human engineers to autonomous systems. This introduces a qualitative shift from existing self-adaptive and self-organising systems, moving from self-adaptation based on predefined variation types, towards more open contexts involving novel autonomous subsystems, collaborative behaviours, and emerging goals. In this article, we revisit existing SISSY research efforts and establish a corresponding terminology focusing on how SISSY relates to the broad field of integration sciences. We then investigate SISSY-related research efforts and derive a taxonomy of SISSY technology. This is concluded by establishing a research road-map for developing operational self-improving self-integrating systems.}

abstract = {To inform data-driven decisions in fighting the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, this research develops a spatiotemporal analysis framework under the combination of an ensemble model (random forest regression) and a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II). It has been verified for four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, and Nepal. Accordingly, we can gain some valuable experience to better understand the disease evolution, forecast the prevalence of the disease, which can provide sustainable evidence to guide further intervention and management. Random forest with a proper rolling time-window can learn the combined effects of environmental and social factors to accurately predict the daily growth of confirmed cases and daily death rate on a national scale, which is followed by NSGA-II to find a range of Pareto optimal solutions for ensuring the minimization of the infection rate and mortality at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictive model can alert the local government in advance, allowing the accused time to put forward relevant measures. The temperature in the category of environment and the stringency index belonging to the social factor are identified as the top 2 important features to exert a greater impact on the virus transmission. Moreover, optimal solutions provide references to design the best control strategies towards pandemic containment and prevention that can accommodate the country-specific circumstance, which are possible to decrease the two objectives by more than 95%. In particular, appropriate adjustment of social-related features needs to take priority over others, since it can bring about at least 1.47% average improvement of two objectives compared to environmental factors.}

abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of the anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi since 2013 on coal mine mortality in China. Combining several unique provincial-level datasets on coal mines from 2004 to 2017, we find evidence that provinces with stronger exposure to the anti-corruption campaign have experienced a significantly larger decrease in coalmine death rates. This effect survives a vast array of robustness checks and also displays great heterogeneity. Further evidence suggests the campaign has led to fewer safety violations, more fixed investments and a decrease in profits accompanied by an increase in the costs of principal business in the coal mining industry. The above findings are most consistent with the interpretation that the campaign has made coal mining firms less likely to shirk on safety by curbing collusion between coal mines and local officials. We also rule out other channels such as intensified inspection and the change of employment composition in the industry.}

abstract = {The importance of an optimal solution for disaster evacuation has recently raised attention from researchers across multiple disciplines. This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees’ behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages. This work extends the existing data-oriented framework by outlining comprehensive functionalities and providing seamless integration. We review the principles, challenges, and future direction of the state-of-the-art strategies proposed to sit within each functionality. Taken together, this survey highlights the importance of adaptive coordination and reconfiguration within the fog services to facilitate responsive mass evacuations as well as open up new research challenges associated with analytics-embedding network and computation, which is critical for any disaster recovery activities.}

abstract = {This chapter is dedicated to the overview of extreme weather events and their impacts, as well as the introduction of forecasting concepts and techniques. There are many types of weather extremes that are accompanied by a continuously increasing research literature that contemplates interconnections between human and natural influences, especially with regard to climate change (Robinson, 2021). The events we describe in this chapter are not a complete list. We provide definitions of extreme weather events (Section 1.1) that pose significant societal and economic impacts and are represented by case studies in the chapters that follow. Most of the event types and techniques described here are analyzed further and more extensively in Chapter 2. An overview of current weather forecasting practices is presented in Section 1.2. Furthermore, in this chapter, we provide comprehensive reviews for extreme weather forecasting in urban areas (Section 1.3) and prediction of wildfires (Section 1.4). Urban areas represent scales and complex environments that affect a large part of the population. Wildfires, despite being primarily of natural origin, have a complex relationship with extreme weather conditions and increasingly devastating effects on the built environment and the society. Thus, we need to be able to better understand and predict them accurately in space and time.}
