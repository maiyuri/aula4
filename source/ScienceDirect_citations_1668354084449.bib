abstract = {With the advancement in communication techniques and sensor technologies, mobile crowdsensing (MCS)—one of the most successful applications of crowdsourcing—has recently become a powerful tool to solve complex and scalable sensing problems. Generally, MCS is a location-aware crowdsourcing technique in which participating workers must physically move to a specific location to complete tasks. Hence, workers must disclose information regarding their current true location to service providers. However, location information may contain sensitive data; therefore, most workers are not comfortable—or are even reluctant—to provide their exact location information to service providers because of privacy concerns. This is perceived as the most significant challenge faced in MCS. Thus, guaranteeing location privacy is essential for attracting more participants to actively participate in MCS. Accordingly, extensive studies have been conducted in the past few years to protect the location privacy of participating workers in MCS. In this study, we comprehensively survey the state-of-the-art mechanisms for protecting the location privacy of workers in MCS. We divide the location protection mechanisms into three categories depending on the nature of their algorithm and compare them from the viewpoints of architecture, privacy, computational overhead, and utility. Moreover, we discuss certain promising future research directions to spur further research in this area.}

abstract = {Summary
In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), urgent action is needed to curb a growing crisis in cancer incidence and mortality. Without rapid interventions, data estimates show a major increase in cancer mortality from 520 348 in 2020 to about 1 million deaths per year by 2030. Here, we detail the state of cancer in SSA, recommend key actions on the basis of analysis, and highlight case studies and successful models that can be emulated, adapted, or improved across the region to reduce the growing cancer crises. Recommended actions begin with the need to develop or update national cancer control plans in each country. Plans must include childhood cancer plans, managing comorbidities such as HIV and malnutrition, a reliable and predictable supply of medication, and the provision of psychosocial, supportive, and palliative care. Plans should also engage traditional, complementary, and alternative medical practices employed by more than 80% of SSA populations and pathways to reduce missed diagnoses and late referrals. More substantial investment is needed in developing cancer registries and cancer diagnostics for core cancer tests. We show that investments in, and increased adoption of, some approaches used during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as hypofractionated radiotherapy and telehealth, can substantially increase access to cancer care in Africa, accelerate cancer prevention and control efforts, increase survival, and save billions of US dollars over the next decade. The involvement of African First Ladies in cancer prevention efforts represents one practical approach that should be amplified across SSA. Moreover, investments in workforce training are crucial to prevent millions of avoidable deaths by 2030. We present a framework that can be used to strategically plan cancer research enhancement in SSA, with investments in research that can produce a return on investment and help drive policy and effective collaborations. Expansion of universal health coverage to incorporate cancer into essential benefits packages is also vital. Implementation of the recommended actions in this Commission will be crucial for reducing the growing cancer crises in SSA and achieving political commitments to the UN Sustainable Development Goals to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030.}

Despite achieving close or even superior performance to that of experts, there is a critical gap between development and integration of AI systems in ophthalmic practice. This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to close that gap. We identify the main aspects or challenges that need to be considered along the AI design pipeline so as to generate systems that meet the requirements to be deemed trustworthy, including those concerning accuracy, resiliency, reliability, safety, and accountability. We elaborate on mechanisms and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market surveillance after regulatory approval. This work contributes to establish such multi-stakeholder interaction and the main action points to be taken so that the potential benefits of AI reach real-world ophthalmic settings.}

Therefore, it is highly desirable to put in place intelligent preventive maintenance measures to diagnose and evaluate the condition of power transformers. Although conventional methods have achieved success in detecting problems associated with power transformers, their adoption rate in practical environments is still far from universal. The advent of Computational Intelligence (CI) models offers useful potential to complement the existing diagnostic practices of power transformers. In this paper, we provide a review on various computational intelligence techniques for fault detection and diagnosis pertaining to preventive maintenance of power transformers. An overview of each representative CI approach is presented to facilitate researchers in selecting an appropriate method for a specific problem at hand. We carry out a broad discussion on numerous concerns and challenges that are missing from the current literature, which, nevertheless, need to be addressed seriously. We identify the research gaps in the literature, and suggest the way forward in research that will in the long run enhance power system reliability by embracing CI approaches into business operations in an effort to realize the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) advocated by the United Nation, primarily SDG7: Clean and Affordable Energy and SDG9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background and aims
Publicly available databases containing colonoscopic imaging data are valuable resources for artificial intelligence (AI) research. Currently, little is known regarding the available number and content of these databases. This review aimed to describe the availability, accessibility and usability of publicly available colonoscopic imaging databases, focusing on polyp detection, polyp characterization and quality of colonoscopy.
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase to identify AI-studies describing publicly available colonoscopic imaging datasets published after 2010. Second, a targeted search using Google’s Dataset Search, Google Search, GitHub and Figshare was done to identify datasets directly. Datasets were included if they contained data about polyp detection, polyp characterization or quality of colonoscopy. To assess accessibility of datasets the following categories were defined: open access, open access with barriers and regulated access. To assess the potential usability of the included datasets, essential details of each dataset were extracted using a checklist derived from the CLAIM-checklist.
Results
We identified 22 datasets with open access, 3 datasets open access with barriers and 15 datasets with regulated access. The 22 open access databases containing 19,463 images and 952 videos. Nineteen of these databases focused on polyp detection, localization and/or segmentation, six on polyp characterization and three on quality of colonoscopy. Only half of these databases have been used by other researcher to develop, train or benchmark their AI-system. Although technical details were in general well-reported, important details such as polyp and patient demographics and the annotation process were underreported in almost all databases.
Conclusion
This review provides greater insight on public availability of colonoscopic imaging databases for AI-research. Incomplete reporting of important details limits the ability of researchers to assess the usability of the current databases.}

abstract = {Target maneuver trajectory prediction is an important prerequisite for air combat situation awareness and maneuver decision-making. However, how to use a large amount of trajectory data generated by air combat confrontation training to achieve real-time and accurate prediction of target maneuver trajectory is an urgent problem to be solved. To solve this problem, in this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on transfer learning, online learning, ensemble learning, regularization technology, target maneuvering segmentation point recognition algorithm, and Volterra series, abbreviated as AERTrOS-Volterra is proposed. Firstly, the model makes full use of a large number of trajectory sample data generated by air combat confrontation training, and constructs a Tr-Volterra algorithm framework suitable for air combat target maneuver trajectory prediction, which realizes the extraction of effective information from the historical trajectory data. Secondly, in order to improve the real-time online prediction accuracy and robustness of the prediction model in complex electromagnetic environments, on the basis of the Tr-Volterra algorithm framework, a robust regularized online Sequential Volterra prediction model is proposed by integrating online learning method, regularization technology and inverse weighting calculation method based on the priori error. Finally, inspired by the preferable performance of models ensemble, ensemble learning scheme is also incorporated into our proposed algorithm, which adaptively updates the ensemble prediction model according to the performance of the model on real-time samples and the recognition results of target maneuvering segmentation points, including the adaptation of model weights; adaptation of parameters; and dynamic inclusion and removal of models. Compared with many existing time series prediction methods, the newly proposed target maneuver trajectory prediction algorithm can fully mine the prior knowledge contained in the historical data to assist the current prediction. The rationality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified by simulation on three sets of chaotic time series data sets and a set of real target maneuver trajectory data sets.}

Concerning the critical role of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in tackling the problem of traffic congestion, and enhancing the safety, mobility and sustainability of the transport network, this paper provides a comprehensive review of recent developments in Connected Vehicle (CV) technology, its features and terminology. The real-world implementation of the CV technologies can result in a better understanding of the practical and technical issues. Given the technical and conceptual challenges, as well as novelty factors associated with CVs, many CV pilot studies around the world are reviewed, and their findings are summarized. The paper contributes to the literature by reviewing the characteristics, communication platform, multimodality, size and type of study areas of the pilot CV testbeds across the world. This research also paves the way for the better development of CV technology by comparing and discussing the pros and cons of the existing CV pilot testbeds. Moreover, we have discussed the evaluation plans and the advantages and disadvantages of different testbeds. Besides, as a main component of the CV system, the traffic signal control algorithms, as well as transit signal priority in a CV ecosystem, are also reviewed. Based on our findings, the real-time data obtained from the CV system could result in a better adjustment of traffic signal parameters which consequently enhance the traffic regulation in the network (say up to 30% in terms of travel time in comparison with an actuated coordinated traffic signal). However, a major criticism of the existing traffic signal strategies in a CV system is that they do not utilize the maximum capability of the CV system (V2 V, V2I and I2I communications).}

Despite its unrivaled capability for directly fabricating metal parts with complex geometries, the wide realization of the technology is currently limited by microstructural defects and anomalies, which could significantly degrade the structural integrity and service performance of the product. Accurate detection, characterization, and prediction of these defects and anomalies have an important and immediate impact in manufacturing fully-dense and defect-free builds. This review seeks to elucidate common defects/anomalies and their formation mechanisms in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes. They could arise from raw materials, processing conditions, and post-processing. While defects/anomalies in laser welding have been studied extensively, their formation and evolution remain unclear. Additionally, the existence of powder in powder bed fusion techniques may generate new types of defects, e.g., porosity transferring from powder to builds. Practical strategies to mitigate defects are also addressed through fundamental understanding of their formation. Such explorations enable the validation and calibration of models and ease the process qualification without costly trial-and-error experimentation.}
